I started Tai Chi when I was twenty-two.  I studied a little, got fascinated and quit. I didn't have the patience for it.

I took a course again when I was twenty-five.  I learned more of [Cheng Man Ching's]({{site.url}}/relax) form and quit again.

When I turned thirty, I returned once again and got serious.  More life experience taught me Tai Chi is a wonderful blend of health, social skills, philosophy and martial arts.  It's good to invest in holistic things that pay back across the board.

I've returned to daily Tai Chi again recently and it feels great to keep the thread going.
