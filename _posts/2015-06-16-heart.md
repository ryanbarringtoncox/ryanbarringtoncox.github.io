I write about process, thinking and other heady things here.  I love the mind.  I'm intrigued by psychology and methodologies.

**There is a side of me that wants nothing but heart.**

Heart is feeling.

Heart is empathy.

Heart is down below my neck, in my blood, holding my blood, out of my head.

**Heart is feeling.**

For a decade, I wanted to travel the country and sing my songs.  I wanted to connect on a heart level and sing about things we all know.

I'm still striving to connect on a heart level, though [my plans](/have-a-plan) have changed.

Our minds are glorious.

Let's consult our hearts too.
