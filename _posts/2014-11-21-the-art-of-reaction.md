“Be ok with the way things are.”  Wise words from my wife.  They didn’t sink in the first few dozen times.  They are sinking in now.

Such a simple concept.  Something I struggle with so much.  When I’m running late in the morning and I grab my daughter’s milk and it spills everywhere.  When I’m awakened in the middle of the night by screaming dogs.  When I lose money foolishly.

It’s easy to be pleasant and agreeable when things are going my way.  **When things go off the rails, that’s when I find out who I really am.**

I’d like to be more aware when the shit hits the fan. I'd like to keep a grip on the wheel of peril.  At the very least, I'd like to refrain from making bad situations worse.  Some strategies:

1.  **Look through the rage for a laugh.**  If I can get a laugh in the middle of a rage storm, that's a major score. Whether it's someone else or me laughing deliriously alone, it takes guts to laugh at my own devil.
2.  **Step back from an argument and see a reasonable person on the other side.** "Why would a reasonable, sane person have this point of view?"  Can I ask myself that in the middle of a fight? 
3.  **Take a pride hit for the greater good.**  Being right isn't supreme. Often times, I can be right **or** make peace.  Seldom both.  Choose my battles wisely and know when to swallow pride.

I’m not saying I want to ignore my frustrations, bury them or pretend they’re not there.  Just the opposite.  I want to go head to head, acknowledge them, be aware as soon as they arise.  I want to sit with frustration and try to better understand it.

I’ve wasted enough time and health holding onto negative feelings, surrendering my power to the external. **I yearn to take responsibility for my reactions, to own them and try to make art with them.**

I hereby publicly commit to the pursuit of the **Art of Reaction**.  There are sure to be failures along the way.  Next time you see me freak out, please remind me that I wrote this.
