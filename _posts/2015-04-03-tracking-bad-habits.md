Bad habits.  We all have them.  Maybe you bite your fingernails, drink too much or interrupt people when you get excited.

If you're intent on changing a bad habit, track it.  Every time you do it, write it down on paper or in a spreadsheet. It doesn't matter how you track it.  You just have to do it every day and keep at it.

Tracking bad habits can be brutal because you're fessing up to yourself, shining a light on your undesirable qualities.

It's worth the pain though.  Tracking bad habits will get you to notice them more.  This is the quickest way I've found to reduce (and possibly eliminate) a bad habit.

There's something magical about acknowledging your flaw, putting it on your daily radar.

**You don't even have to try to do the bad habit less.  Just right it down.  And keep at it.**

Tracking bad habits has worked wonders for me.  The important thing is to be diligent (and of course, you have to want to change the habit in the first place).

Track a bad habit for a few months and you will see it decline.
