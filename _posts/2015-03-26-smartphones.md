I hop onto my smartphone subconsciously, without intending to. I'll catch myself picking up the phone and **then** deciding what to check (email, facebook, etc).

This is something to be aware of. The internet, wireless technology and blazingly fast processors bring me more information than I could've imagined as a child. All in the palm of my hand.  It's awesome.

Still, I want to set limits and know when to shut off technology, leave it off and watch lights and shadows dance around before my eyes. The best things in life are real, non-virtual stuff.

I recall a trip to a cabin last year that had no internet or cell reception. The weekend was alive and present with life. Vital.

As a hacker and lover of technology, I'm searching for the balance between technology and awareness, and it's only in one place.

Right here.  Right now.

So I'm going to turn the damn thing off for a while ; )

Smartphones can be amazing and wonderful, but I want to keep myself present in the real world first and foremost.
