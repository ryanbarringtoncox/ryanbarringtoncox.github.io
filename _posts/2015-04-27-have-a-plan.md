It's good to make plans, even when I know they'll change.

I've been learning [react.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/).  It's fun, challenging and [frustrating](http://trailofsparks.org/frustration/). The typical variety that comes with learning something new.

I tried to attack from one side and only got so far.  Then I tried another and got a little farther.  Then another.

Learning new things is tough, especially when you have to think in new ways.  It's a great exercise, but not for the weak-willed.

There are days where I feel weak-willed and hear that voice.  "You should be farther along than this.  You can't do it!"

It's best to stop and reevaluate at this point.

Step back.

Take a break.

Walk around.

Eat something slowly.

It also helps to have a plan before I dive into something challenging.  Dream up a series of steps.  Write them out.  "I'm going to do this.  Then this.  Then this."

Make a first-draft algorithm.  This alleviates some of the burden when I'm in the thick of it. I can defer to the plan I made with a clear head.

Every plan is always a draft to be tweaked, re-written or thrown out.  I can make a new plan for each learning session.

**String enough evolving plans together and I'll have something refined.**

Plans change and shouldn't be set in stone.  Still, it's great to have them written out.  It's one less thing to negotiate during the frustrating times.
