I was walking through downtown Asheville, enjoying the [present]({{site.url}}/present) and savoring life, when I came upon a herd of tourists.

They were fanned across the sidewalk, dawdling in a thick cluster.  I could not cut through them and they did not notice my attempts to pass.  My heart rate increased as I called out to them.

"Excuse me. Can you quit appreciating the beauty of this city?  I'm trying to take it for granted here! Quit savoring your precious time on earth and get out of the way!!"
