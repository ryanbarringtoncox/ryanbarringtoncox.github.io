I love completing things. I thrive on accomplishing tasks, achieving goals and basking in the glow of a job well done.

It's difficult for me to leave things unfinished. It often wears on me to have a project running on and off for weeks, months or years.  Sometimes I can't shake the need to finish something right now.

**Unfinished business can be agitating.**

And yet unfinished business is unavoidable.  Some jobs are so big that they must remain unfinished for long stretches. Some jobs must wait on somebody or something else to come through.  In these cases, I must relax into unfinished business and live with it.

As a homeowner, I'm constantly challenged by unfinished business because the homeowner to-do list is never "to-done." Ever. You can bust your ass completing things but the to-do list just smiles and grows.

**I will never finish all the jobs on my house, no matter how hard I try.**

So I strive to plan well and focus on the task at hand.  I strive to walk away from the job when I can't do any more and accept unfinished business as a part of life.  It's wasteful to stay up late, tossing and turning about unfinished business.

Sometimes the job can't be finished right now. When this is the case, I'll make my peace with unfinished business and focus on other things (like relaxing).
