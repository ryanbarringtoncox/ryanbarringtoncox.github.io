Be your own administrator.

For example, commit to ninety minutes of uninterrupted work learning a new skill in the morning.  Then quit, relax and repeat in the afternoon.  Do this for a few weeks, tracking hours and progress and it really adds up.

Being deliberate about my time helps me ward off frustration and find patterns in the [chaos]({{site.url}}/book-notes/chaos).

Be deliberate.
