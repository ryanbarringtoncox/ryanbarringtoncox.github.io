I just posted some new and old audio content on my [bandcamp page](https://ryanbarringtoncox.bandcamp.com/), including -

  - a [new stand-up comedy set](https://ryanbarringtoncox.bandcamp.com/track/stand-up-the-grey-eagle-3-25-2017), from a sold-out showcase at the Grey Eagle
  - [my early recordings from 2001-2002](https://ryanbarringtoncox.bandcamp.com/album/the-early-years-vol-i-2001-2002)
  - a [Live in Australia EP](https://ryanbarringtoncox.bandcamp.com/album/live-in-australia-2006) 

It's an interesting thing to go back 5, 10, 15 years and see how my voice, writing and perspective have changed.

I'm glad I've recorded things along the way.
