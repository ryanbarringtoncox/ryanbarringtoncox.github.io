I've tended to spend lots of time around people who share my tastes and opinions.  I think most of us are like this.

It can be relaxing and fun to spend time around people who share our views, our language and our sense of style.  We can even argue about the nuances of the things we agree on. ; ) 

These past few years, I've started spending more time around people who aren't like me.  People of different ages on different careers paths.  People with different goals.  These people dress and move differently than I do. 

**People who aren't like me challenge me to expand, to grow and to think in new ways.**

There's a lot to be gained from rubbing shoulders with people who are nothing like me.  Instead of getting validated, I'm challenged to consider alternate approaches to life.  It's best if these people have ambition and purpose.

There's nothing wrong with spending time around people who are like me.  I don't want to lose that comfort.  However, I don't want it to be my easy default either.  **A lot of spark and spice come from spending time with people who aren't like me.**

Since I've been spending more time around people who aren't like me, I've noticed that I'm less like the people I used to be like.

It's a moving target.  Everything changes. So should I.
