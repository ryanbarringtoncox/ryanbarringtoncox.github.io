Right now, I'm working on -

  - Being [present]({{ site.url }}/present), especially as a husband and father. I want to [enjoy]({{site.url}}/enthusiasm) my time, listen, laugh, [love]({{ site.url }}/ten-posts-on-love) and [communicate]({{site.url}}/have-a-point)
  - Living [healthily]({{ site.url }}/sleep-nutrition-exercise)
  - Becoming a kickass [software tester]({{ site.url }}/plunge-in-and-quit)
  - [Leading]({{site.url}}/love-your-audience/) my [speaking club]({{site.url}}/public-speaking-and-living-with-fear) as president, writing/performing a new [story or speech]({{ site.url }}/stories) each month
  - [Blogging]({{ site.url }}/posts) my way through life's lessons

These are my priorities. It's helpful to write them down and revisit them periodically.

My [/bucket page]({{site.url}}/bucket) holds the things I'll do someday, when I have time.
