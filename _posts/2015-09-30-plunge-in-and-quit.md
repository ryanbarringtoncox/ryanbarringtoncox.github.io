"Plunge in and quit."

I'm borrowing this line from the book, [Lessons Learned in Software Testing](http://www.amazon.com/Lessons-Learned-Software-Testing-Context-Driven/dp/0471081124). You can apply the plunge-in-and-quit heuristic to any overwhelming problem.

It's tempting to avoid overwhelming problems or push too hard, wear yourself out trying to solve them.

It's more effective to plunge into the challenge, explore, experiment, play around.

When you get overwhelmed, [frustrated]({{ site.url  }}/frustration) or confused, quit.  You don't have to solve this right now. You don't have drain yourself or beat yourself up.

Go do something else. Or do nothing.  [Relax]({{ site.url }}/relax) and let your subconscious chew on the problem for a while.

After you've recharged:

  - Plunge in again with a new approach.
  - Get confused.
  - Quit again.
  - Repeat.

Plunge-in-and-quit builds iteratively and keeps [morale]({{ site.url }}/morale) up.  It's a better use of time and energy than pushing too hard, wearing yourself out or punching a wall.

Plunge-in-and-quit works for programming, songwriting, recording, studying for exams, practicing speeches - anything that can't be solved in a single sitting.

I've known this truth, but I'd never heard it put so well:

Plunge in and quit!
