What’s the one thing I want to get done today?

This is the kind of self-talk I’m working on right now.  **Forget multitasking.  Do one thing and kick ass at it.**  I’ve recently learned that doing one thing well every day adds up to far more accomplishments than switching between several things throughout the day.

**Pick something.**

**Focus.**

**Go.**

This post is just about one thing.  That’s it.
