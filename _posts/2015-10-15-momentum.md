Motion is the natural state of things.  You are always moving, changing, becoming different and new.  One moment to the next.

Stagnation is myth.

**A snapshot may be beautiful but it’s not real.**

You can set things in motion in your own life - education, relationships, love, art, health, new [risky]({{ site.url  }}/stability) ideas.  The universe expects this of you.

Getting over initial friction, getting up from rest is the hardest part.  Once you’re moving, it's easier to keep moving. Soon you're sailing down a green hill, wind in your face and gravity is doing all the hard work.

Go gather some motion, distance, speed.  Get some momentum under your belt. Let things happen breezily.

A rolling stone gathers no moss.
