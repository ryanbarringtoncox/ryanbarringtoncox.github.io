Sometimes the path of least resistance is the path of most resistance.

The path of least resistance is the quickest, easiest way to achieve something, right?

Often times, the quickest and easiest way to reach a **longterm** goal is to endure stress, [challenges](/people-who-challenge-us) and [threats](/threat).

**Resistance can accelerate our learning if it doesn’t crush us.**

Don’t get crushed.

Know the limits.

Keep at the edges of those limits.

**Expand those limits.**

Sometimes the path of least resistance is the path of most resistance.
