title: Adapt
---
It's taken me 25 years of playing music to realize that you don't figure out how to make the sounds you're after. You figure out how to adapt your sounds to different spaces, moments, people, times, weather, feelings. You never get all the way there.  It keeps unraveling, going deeper and deeper.

Adapting and listening, staying nimble with empathy for the moment. These are the great skills, and they go well beyond music.
