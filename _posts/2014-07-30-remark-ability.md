I have spent decades of energy and time writing songs, recording them and playing them for people.  I’ve been striving to be great, to write amazing songs that make people feel the way I felt when I was a teenager with headphones on.  Riding the bus home, lost in bliss.  Until recently, all other pursuits came second to making music.

Booking shows is not easy.  Getting up in front of a bar room crowd and trying to hold their attention, make them feel, make them care for forty minutes?  Not easy either.  The mission was challenging, thrilling even.  There was no instruction manual.  We wrote our own, and we had some successes and some failures.

Fve years ago, I turned 30 and felt like trying some different things.  I tried computer programming and got a response right away.  Whoah, the world needs programmers!  Interesting.  I’ve had three jobs in the past five years, each better than the last (ok, ok, maybe the first one wasn’t a real “job job” but it was a start).  More recently, I’ve started doing some speaking projects and I’ve gotten a good response from that too.  Hm, not that many people are willing to get up and speak either [wheels start turning in my head].

So what gets a response?  What’s needed?  Where are the gaps, the holes that need filling?  Where is the overlap between fun, fulfilling work and opportunity?  I’ll be honest and say, for me, it’s nice to get a response, to be heard, to do something that’s not falling on deaf ears.

We carry rectangles in our pockets that allow instant access to nearly every piece of recorded music, ever.  How badly does the world need a new song?  When we hear a new band that’s really good or even great, how big of a deal is that?  Are we compelled to buy the record, replay the song for months, years?

Where are the saturations?

Where are the voids?

Don’t get me wrong.  Music is beautiful, religious.  I’ll always do it.  Writing songs and recording them, putting your heart out there, playing a new song for a close friend - it doesn’t get any better than that!   I’m just not sure that the world needs more songs right now.  And I’m not sure that I want to spend much energy pushing my songs on the world.

Einstein said doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result is the definition of insanity.  I’ve noticed that trying different, riskier things is bringing different, more interesting results.  Is that the definition of sanity?

Anybody who has spent time trying to book shows knows how draining it can be.  I’m talking about how much energy you get back for what you’re putting in.  There are so many great bands out there, playing for free!

The astute reader might be saying something like, “Yes, well, there are plenty of bloggers out there giving it away for free too!  Does the world need another blogger?”  To that I say, “You are a smartass.  But you’ve got a point.”

This blog is new.  For me.  It’s a challenge, an attempt to mix things up, try something different, expand creatively, get out of my comfort zone.  Let’s take a stab and see what happens.
