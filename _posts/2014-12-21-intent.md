What am I going to do next?

And what do I want to accomplish while doing it?

**Lately I’m getting better results when I’m intentional, when I visualize the outcome of my efforts beforehand.**  It only takes a few moments and pays off handsomely.

Things never go exactly the way I want, but intention is steering them in a more positive direction.

So what are you going to do after you read this?

How do you want it to go down?

Can you visualize it?
