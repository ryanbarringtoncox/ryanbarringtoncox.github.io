The rookie focuses on himself.

The pro, the sage, the leader always keeps "them" in mind.

"They" can be your spouse, child, bandmate, coworker, neighbor, a random person at the store.  Anybody that you're interacting with, really.

When you're speaking to someone, are you focused on yourself?

Or on them?

**If you can keep the emphasis on them most of the time, you are in an elite minority.**

Most of us think about ourselves all the time.  When we see a group picture, our eyes go straight to ourselves. When we address a group, we are thinking about what we're saying, how we look.

People want to feel important.  They want our consideration, our attention.

People are not dumb.  We all have a sixth sense for sincerity.

We can help people by giving them our attention.

This helps us too because our ideas are more likely to resonate when we are empathetic and considerate.

Win.  Win.

Putting the emphasis on them and giving what they want is something to strive for.

These ideas were heavily influenced by [Dale Carnegie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Carnegie).  I've tested them and they work.
