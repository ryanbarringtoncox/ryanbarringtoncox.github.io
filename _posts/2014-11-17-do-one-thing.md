What’s the one thing I want to get done today?

This is the kind of self-talk I’m working on right now.  **Forget multitasking.  Do one thing and kick ass at it.**

It takes energy and time to switch contexts.  To cache.  To find new flow.

I'm discovering that doing one thing well every day adds up to more accomplishments than switching between several things throughout the day.

**The allure of multitasking is deceiving.  Doing more things does not produce more results.  Nay.  Tis better to go deeper with fewer.**

Pick something.

Focus.

Go.

This post is  about one thing.  That’s it.
