*"All models are wrong but some are useful." - George E.P. Box*

All my facts, measurements and impressions are limited.  I don't see the world as it is.  Rather, I model the world in my mind.

I can sharpen these measurements and perhaps get closer to the truth, but my [mental models]({{ site.url }}/mental-models) will always be limited.

Knowing that my perceptions are limited is freeing because I don't have to be right all the time.  I don't have to convince others to adopt my view. I don't have to adopt supposed experts' views either.

**When I realize I'm merely modeling the world, I understand the power of collaboration.**

Combine multiple models and the results stretch far beyond the sum.  As collaborators, we each bring a unique creative view to the table.  We can explore, converse and get farther together than we ever will alone.

Let's collaborate.

Let's describe and combine our models.

Let's remember: Everything we perceive is a model, a limited slice of reality.

What a relief to know we aren't always right.
