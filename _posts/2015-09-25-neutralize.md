Sometimes I push back on the people that push me.

This gives them more to push against and the pushing war begins.

**Tis better to neutralize, roll with the push.**

I'm not talking about being submissive or cowering.

I'm talking about standing ground and turning out of the way whenever possible.

**Let the aggressor wear himself out.**

Reacting to aggressive energy with more aggression seldom ends well.

Energy and time are precious commodities, not to be wasted.

I have pushed back by default too often.

**Push less.**

**Neutralize more.**
