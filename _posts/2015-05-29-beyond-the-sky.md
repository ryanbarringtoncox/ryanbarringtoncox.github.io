Here is a song that I wrote ten years ago.  It stands out to me now because I feel optimistic when I sing it. When I go back and play my songs from that era, they are often bleak-sounding.  This tune, *Beyond the Sky*, feels hopeful, the way I strive to be now. 

I'm not exactly sure what this song is about, but it describes faith beyond death.  No particular faith, mind you, as I don't consider myself a religious person.

**I do believe in a higher togetherness that we'll all return to someday and that gives me hope. It feels damn good to sing about such things.**

It's hard to describe faith because words can be overloaded and limited.  That's where songs come in.  They travel through the air, and change that very medium through compression and rarefaction.  Songs are different every time you sing them.

**Songs are magic.**

Long story short, I mixed up Siddhartha, Bob Dylan and Carl Sagan and came up with this tune.  You can watch a video of the song [on YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcvabFdoYGg) and read the lyrics below.

See you back beyond the sky someday, my friend!

### Beyond the sky
it's getting so dark I can't see my sneakers \\
blackness has filled up my mind\\
stumble through the dark\\
trying to find a spark\\
to light the lamp that fills my heart with shine\\
\\
beyond the sky, beyond the sky\\
that's where you're going\\
beyond the sky\\
\\
if you get so sick and tired of what you're saying\\
and your ears can't bear the hot and shaky sound\\
if you don't know where to look\\
when you're hanging on a hook\\
just remember that your soul is in the clouds\\
\\
beyond the sky, beyond the sky\\
that's where you're going\\
beyond the sky\\
\\
you need a song to sing\\
you need one badly\\
you need somebody to treat you right\\
you need a song to sing\\
you need one badly\\
where can you go?\\
where can you go?\\
where can you go now?\\
\\
beyond the sky, beyond the sky\\
that's where you're going\\
beyond the sky\\
beyond the sky\\
beyond the sky
