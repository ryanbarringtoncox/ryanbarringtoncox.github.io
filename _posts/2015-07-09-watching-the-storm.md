Some days, I have so much noise in my head.  Hopes, worries, dreams, desires, fears, unsolved problems.

Laundry!

When I meditate on these days, I often see disappointment too.  There is a part of me that's disappointed because I want meditation to be calm, peaceful and easy. I want it to feel good.

Some days meditation does feel good.  It's a pleasure to watch my breath and be calm, present on these days.

Other days, meditation is like watching a storm.  My mental storm.

There is a tendency to turn away from unpleasant things like agitation.  "Hey, this is difficult!  Maybe I should eat or watch a movie instead."

Turning away from the storm is a missed opportunity.

**There is a lot to be learned from my internal storm.**

For one thing, it's helpful to know that today is a stormy day inside.  This is valuable information.  I might not even notice I'm stormy unless I sit and watch. 

Often times, I'm not aware of what's lurking beneath the surface of my thoughts.  Something might be bothering me from the distant past or a hypothetical future.

My internal storms, emotional and mental, are here to teach me.

**There is beauty within the chaos.**

On stormy days, I can learn by sitting still and watching the storm.  No need to try to fix the storm, dissect it or do anything besides be aware of it.

All storms pass.
