title: Yin and Yang

I got excited about [Deep Work]({{site.url}}/deep-work) last month.  I've been [stretching]({{site.url}}/stretch-zone) it and productivity has gotten a big boost. 

Last week I noticed I was feeling a bit isolated.  Hiding out and getting in an ultra-focused solo mindset has side effects.  I found myself walking through the halls at work quicker, less aware of others, less open to connection.  I was socially off my game.

These [last]({{site.url}}/reach) [few]({{site.url}}/trial-by-crowd) posts have focused on connecting with the people around me, which feels like the opposite of [deliberation]({{site.url}}/deliberate).

**This is a pattern I've seen many times. I focus on one thing, then notice its opposite is lacking, so I focus on that.**

It might seem contradictory, but this is yin and yang at work - two equal and opposite forces balancing (and becoming) one another.

Now I want to unify deep, focused work with more [empathy]({{site.url}}/empathy) and connection to the people around me.

Once I figure this thing out, I'll probably notice its opposite and focus on that.
