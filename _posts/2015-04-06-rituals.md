It's harder to create new habits than to keep old ones.

It's harder to gain new customers than to keep existing ones.

**It takes more energy to put a stationary object in motion than to keep one moving.**

Such is the power of rituals. Once something is happening regularly, it's more likely that it will keep occurring over the long haul.

Initial friction is the hardest part.  Starting something and making it regular, then pushing through the honeymoon period where it's exciting and new. This is the challenge of rituals.

What are your rituals, the things you do daily, weekly?

What rituals do you want to add or remove from your regular routine?

Adding and subtracting rituals is not easy. Don't underestimate them.  If you want to make a change, go slowly, adding or removing rituals one at a time.

Rituals snowball over time, for better or worse.  They're worth keeping an intentional eye on.
