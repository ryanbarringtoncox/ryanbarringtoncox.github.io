title: Two Hundred
---
This is my two-hundredth post in this ongoing experiment.

I send these posts out for fun and exercise, but I rarely get a response or hear from readers, which leaves me wondering:

  - Are there specific posts that stand out to you, for better or worst?
  - Would you like to hear more or less on a particular topic?
  - Is the poetry making you barf?  ; )

I am still relatively new at this and finding my voice.

**So... what is resonating with you?**

Please consider [emailing me](mailto:ryanbarrington@gmail.com).  No need to sugar coat.  Be honest.

(If you receive these posts via email, you can just hit "reply.")

If you're not sure what to write, a compliment paired with criticism is always a good combo.

Thanks for reading and here's to the next two hundred!
