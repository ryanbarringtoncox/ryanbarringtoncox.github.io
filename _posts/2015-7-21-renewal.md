I've lost and found and re-lost so many things.

"Ah ha!  This is how I sing well in front of people!"

"So this is how I build a web application."

"We've finally got this marriage thing figured out!"

Famous last words.  All of them.  The targets are moving.  I should not assume my discoveries will last.

Epiphanies are eternally drifting, towards and away from me.

**It comes down to renewal.  My love for my wife, my family and my work.  I need to constantly renew my love, at least daily, to keep it burning.**

Renew.  Renew.  Renew.

Then renew some more.

Things may change in profoundly sudden ways, but most of the time we are changing gradually, a little bit at a time.  I'm slightly different than I was yesterday. I'll be immeasurably different by my next meal.

Renewal puts me back in my skin.  Back on my feet.  Back in the now.

**Renewal is essential to keeping love alive over the long haul.**

When I've hit my stride and love flows easily, that's beautiful.  I'll enjoy it.  The need for renewal is always just around the corner.
