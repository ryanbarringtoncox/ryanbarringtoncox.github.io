The musicians, speakers and artists that I admire put their souls on the line.

This blog is an attempt to bear my soul, to cultivate a habit of truth and vulnerability.

There are times where I leap up on stage to bear my soul and fail.  I don't connect.  It hurts.

I'll wonder, "What happened?  Did I show something that wasn't truly me? Do they dislike who I am?"

Questions like this can drive me crazy.  Targets are moving.  Success is fleeting.  Answers are scarce.

When we bear our souls, we put ourselves up for judgement.  Judgement hurts and that's part of the ride.

I tend to think it's worthwhile to put our souls on the line, take as much failure as we can and gather feedback.

There's no need to succeed all the time.  Connection is a wonderful high.  Failure is a longterm investment.

Put soul on the line and embrace the successes and failures that come with it.
