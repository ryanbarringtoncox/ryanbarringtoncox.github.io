"This is the way to do it."

That's never true.

That may be *a* way to do it or the way *you* do it, but there are no ultimate methods.  There are only [heuristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic) at best, methods that *seem* to work.

Realizing this limitation is very freeing.

How to make the most of your time with loved ones or learn fly fish?  You can read [others' methods]({{site.url}}/book-notes) or dream up your own theories and test them

There are many ways and, in the end, the methods that seem to work best are still merely heuristics, shadows on the wall.

Learn the rules, then break them.

There is never just one way.
