I’ve spent a couple decades writing songs, recording them and playing them for people.  I have strived to be great, to write amazing songs that make people feel the way I felt when I was a teenager with headphones on.  Riding the bus home, lost in bliss.  Until recently, all other pursuits came second to making music.

Five years ago, I turned 30 and felt like trying some different things.  I tried computer programming and it was fun and creative, just like music.  It was different (from music) in that I got a strong response right away.  Whoah, the world needs programmers!  Interesting.  In a relatively short period of time, I’ve found great jobs and met lots of new, interesting people.  I started doing some speaking projects, and I’ve gotten an affirming response from that too.  It’s scary and fun to get up and deliver a speech.  Not that many people are willing to to do this.  Interesting indeed.

This got me asking some questions.  What gets a response?  What’s needed?  Where are the gaps, the holes that need filling?  If we are feeling frustrated, why not change our approach?  Where is the overlap between fun, fulfilling work and opportunity?

We carry hard rectangles in our pockets that allow instant access to nearly every piece of recorded music, ever.  How badly does the world need a new song?  When we hear a new band that’s really good or even great, how big of a deal is that?  Are we compelled to buy the record, replay the song for months, years?

Where are the saturations?

Where are the voids?

Anybody who has spent time trying to book shows knows how draining it can be.  I’m talking about how much energy you get back for what you’re putting in.  There are so many great bands out there, playing for free!  The astute reader might be saying something like, “Yes, well, there are plenty of bloggers out there giving it away for free too!  Does the world need another blogger?”

You’ve got a point.

This blog is new.  For me.  It’s a challenge, an attempt to mix things up, try something different, expand creatively, get out of my comfort zone.  Doing this feels fun, and a little risky.  It’s giving me energy.

I don’t see myself quitting music.  Music is therapy.  Music is bliss.  That “songs” link at the top of this page isn’t going anywhere!

At the same time, let’s recognize the voids and see if we can fit something cool in there.  Let’s take a stab at something new and see what happens.
