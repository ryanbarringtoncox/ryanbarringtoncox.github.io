Steve Jobs on learning to program:

*"We used it as a way to mirror our thought process. I think everyone should learn how to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think. I view computer science as a liberal art, something everyone should learn to do."*

I love that quote from Steve Jobs.

Programming is about process and thinking in different ways.

Programming lights up different parts of my brain and sparks creativity.

The focus, logic and [mental-modeling]({{site.url}}/models) that I've learned from programming have created positive ripples throughout my life. 

There are an infinite number of ways to approach a problem.  How many can I think of?  What are the pros and cons of each?

When I get [frustrated]({{site.url}}/frustration), my training as a programmer reminds me again to step back, re-think the problem and re-approach.

I have no idea if I'll be writing code in forty years, but I do know that the investment I've made in programming will still be paying off.

If you have an interest in learning to program, go for it.  There's never been a more accessible time.  [Codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com) is one of many great resources online today.
