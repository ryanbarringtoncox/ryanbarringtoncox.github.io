Invest in loss.

This is a [mantra]({{site.url}}/mantras) from [Chen Man-Ching]({{site.url}}/relax).

**If you're afraid to lose, you won't improve.**

When you get pushed a thousand times, you have learned how to be pushed a thousand ways.  You have learned more than the pusher.

Comedian, Louis C.K., bombed, failed miserably when he started performing. Nobody laughed.  He kept coming back. He kept investing in loss.

Life isn't for the weak.

Neither is improvement.

**When you stop failing,  you stop improving.**

Lean into failure.

Invest in loss.
