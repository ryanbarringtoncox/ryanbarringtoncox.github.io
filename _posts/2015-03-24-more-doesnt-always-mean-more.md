More money doesn't bring more happiness.

More power doesn't always boost self esteem.

More people in your life doesn't necessarily mean more love.

There is a point where it's too much to keep up with and it gets away from you.

Your house is too big to maintain.

You have too many social obligations so you can't go deep with any one of them.

You have so many clothes that you can't find the garment you're looking for.

You want to eat better, exercise more and learn something new all at the same time.  You're paralyzed and overwhelmed.

The Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns lurks...

Trim the fat.

Leave the protein.

Keep your possessions minimal.

Your commitments lean.

Keep at the center.

More doesn't always mean more.
