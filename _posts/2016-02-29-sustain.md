It takes years, even decades, to master a craft.  Newness wears off quickly.

It's no wonder most people quit or burn out before they achieve mastery.

I've been blogging and speaking publicly for almost two years now.  These crafts are essentially two sides of the same coin - writing and performing words, trying to connect.

I plan to do more writing and performing each year and keep folding them into my professional life.  If I want to master these crafts, I need to set a sustainable pace.  This means -

  - having fewer ambitions, focusing on [the few things that matter most]({{site.url}}/now)
  - setting clear, measurable [goals]({{site.url}}/have-a-plan) when possible (i.e. 3-month, 1-year, 10-year)
  - [renewing]({{site.url}}/renewal) often
  - [enjoying]({{site.url}}/enjoy) the journey

**Setting a sustainable pace is a key aspect of mastery.**
