New songs are magic.  They capture the way I'm feeling right now. My older songs often feel like they were written by someone else.

Life is dynamic and ever-changing, fluid like music.  The muse is a fleeting and wonderful thing.  In that spirit, here's a new song.

*There's a sound that keeps me up at night*\\
*An ache in my soul that's older than me*\\
*A crooked light that comes through the window*\\
*Slaps a smile on my face, takes me down deep*\\
*Way beneath the surface of the sea*\\
*Where the fish are blue and quick*\\
*I wanna do some good while i'm down here*\\
*Tired of waiting to be picked*\\
\\
*You're my beautiful haunt, yes you are*\\
*You're my beautiful haunt, yes you are*\\
*Fly past the soul of a star*\\
\\
*I'd rather feel too much than be numb*\\
*Rather be too loud than play dumb*\\
*Take the time that I have and beat on this drum*\\
*All the way back to where we come from*\\
*It'll all be over soon enough*\\
*They'll lay me back down in the dirt*\\
*And I'll finally hear old old Jesse's tales*\\
*And understand all the laughter and hurt (but until then)*\\
\\
*You're my beautiful haunt on the handlebars*\\
*You're my beautiful haunt, yes you are*\\
*Fly past the people in cars*\\
\\
*Take this hand, take these truths*\\
*Take my eyes with you across the room*\\
*I wanna hold and be held by you*\\
*Lick your lips and your crooked tooth*\\
\\
*You're my beautiful haunt, yes you are*\\
*You're my beautiful haunt, yes you are*\\
*Fly past the people in cars*\\
*Fly past the soul of a star*
