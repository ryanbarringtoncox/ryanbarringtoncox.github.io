What's your Return on Investment?

**What are you getting back for what you put in?**

I stopped playing shows when I wasn't getting enough joy back to justify all the rehearsals, load-ins, load-outs and booking fiascos.  I miss playing out, but it had become a poor ROI.

It felt great to free up that time and put it into other things.  Things that pay back.

For example, it only takes about twenty minutes to write a blog post (most days), but the insight and spark I get from the exercise can change my whole day for the better.  That's a great ROI!

Speaking publicly is a great ROI too.  I can feel myself confronting lifelong fears and getting bolder and braver. The time invested translates to all aspects of my life. Fantastic ROI.

Time with family?  Killer ROI.  No question. It fills my soul and gives me purpose, meaning.

So...

Where are you  spending your time?

Where are your bad ROIs?

Where are the good ones?

What are you getting back for what you put in?
