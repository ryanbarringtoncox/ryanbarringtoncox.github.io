Don't tell.

Most people tell things.  "This happened, then this happened then this...  blah blah blah."  Who gives a shit?!

Great storytellers don't just *tell* us things.  They *show* us the details of their story - sights, smells, tastes and sounds.  They put us in the moment by acting it out.  We feel the rhythm of their tale. 

We all know what it feels like to squirm internally while someone tells their story.  Force a smile, laugh at the parts that are *supposed* to be funny.  Let the teller feel important.  Those are good manners.  There's nothing wrong with good manners.

When a great storyteller tells us a story, they reel us in.  We willingly get into it.  We taste the nuances, see the colors pop and feel the details.  Our chemistry changes as we're whisked away in the [tension]({{site.url}}/tension), timing and release.

**If you want to improve at storytelling and earn people's attention, show don't tell.**
