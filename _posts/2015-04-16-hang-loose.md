I learn the most when I'm at the edges of my comprehension.  This can be a frustrating place to dwell.

I started learning [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) recently. So far I've had some minor victories and plenty of failures.  Learning a new programming library, language or tool keeps me right at the limit of my understanding.  It's the opposite of being comfortable with my friends, my surroundings, the conversation.

It's the opposite of feeling like a pro, being in control. This is a hard place to [find flow](/flow-breaker).

And yet, the people who keep themselves at the edge consistently learn the most.

**A sponge doesn't soak up when it's clenched tightly.  Neither do I.**

### Notes to self:

  - Keep at the edge of my comfort zone, but be aware of how I'm holding my body, my breath and my brain.  Be self-aware whilst tackling a mental challenge. I'm doing myself a disservice trying to learn in a frustrated state.

  - Pause often.  Take breaks and breathe. Walk around.

  - Stop for the day when I've reached my threshold.

The race is long and we learn the most when we hang loose.
