title: Chance
---
Tell a joke.\\
Start a blog.\\
Take a chance.\\
\\
**Do something scary.**\\
\\
Apply for a job\\
that will\\
double\\
your\\
pay.\\
\\
**Show your\\
appreciation\\
and your love.**\\
\\
Venture out on\\
unexpected\\
limbs.\\
\\
There's fruit\\
at the edges\\
of comfort,\\
apples in\\
chance.\\
\\
Reach out.\\
\\
Pluck one.
