The world offers more distractions every day.

We need focus and we need it now.

**Working in sessions is a great way to focus.**

  - [Plan]({{site.url}}/have-a-plan) out your strategy. Keep the end goal in mind.
  - Block off a chunk of time (perhaps 30, 60 or 90 minutes).
  - [Plunge]({{site.url}}/plunge-in-and-quit) in.
  - Stay focused.  Don't check your inbox, phone, facebook, etc, not even once!
  - Evaluate the results.
  - Repeat as necessary.

We don't have to be "on" all the time, but we do need to maximize the time that we are working.

Want to hit productive strides, focus and produce great work?

Turn off distractions.

**Carve out sessions.**
