title: Commit in Advance

My friend organizes and performs theater shows.  This involves coordinating people, venues, time and much more. It's no easy task.

She commits to doing shows six months in advance and *then* wonders, “How am I going to pull this off?”

**She puts public pressure on herself and then rises to it.**

Try this:

  - Publicly commit
  - Prepare and practice
  - Show up, do your best and enjoy the work
  - Reflect on the experience
  - Repeat

Don't let fear of failure deter you. The more you [fail]({{ site.url }}/failure), the more you'll prevail.

**You'll be surprised what you can achieve when you commit in advance.**
