title: Vulnerable Confidence

I seek the confidence to be vulnerable.  I want to stand my ground *and* trust people, give them the benefit of the doubt.

Let's be honest: There are primal urges beneath the social surface.  We are wilder than we admit.  The potential for conflict is ever-present.  Conflict can be a small misunderstanding or a full-blown physical attack.

Don't confuse arrogance with confidence or vulnerability with cowardice.

  - Arrogance pushes too hard and causes conflict.
  - Cowardice seeks to avoid confrontation and thus draws conflict in.

Both arrogance and cowardice are out of balance.  Each raises the potential for violence.

I seek the confidence to confront problems early and the vulnerability to empathize with others.

Victory comes from vulnerable confidence.
