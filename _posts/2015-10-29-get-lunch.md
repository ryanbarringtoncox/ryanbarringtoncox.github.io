Tension was growing between me and a team member. We didn't see eye to eye.

Soon enough, I caught myself [complaining]({{ site.url }}/back-talk-back) about this person when they weren't around.

When I complain about a team member, I increase tension.  I hurt my credibility.  This is a sure way to make the situation worse. 

I stopped complaining and asked the team member out to lunch instead.  We walked and ate together.  We talked about our careers, families, thoughts and yes, eventually the project too.  We had a lovely time.  I was reminded that this person is a human being with hopes, dreams, worries, doubts and strong opinions, just like me!

After we connected over lunch, the tension went away.  We were back on track.

Get lunch with people.  Get to know them.  Laugh with them.  Embrace different points of view.

There's no amount of complaining, hard work or formal meetings that can compensate for a friendly lunch.
