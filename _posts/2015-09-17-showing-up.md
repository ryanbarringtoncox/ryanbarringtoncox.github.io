Some days I'm on.

Some days I'm not.

Some days I don't feel like showing up at all.

If I don't feel like showing up too many days in a row, I'll consider doing something else.

In the mean time, I'll show up, listen and try to connect.  I'll look for opportunities to do something meaningful.

As long as I'm here, this energy has potential.
