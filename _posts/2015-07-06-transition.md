Today is my last day on this job.  Iâ€™ll start a new job next week.

I'm excited about the change, growth and rhythms that lie ahead.

New people.

New routines.

New ways of thinking.

New [challenges](/people-who-challenge-us) and [frustrations](/frustration) to figure out.

**Transition is an opportunity to reflect on the last two years and renew my sense of purpose moving forward.**

Transition is also a great time for [questions](/question-yourself).

  - What are my goals?
  - What are my hopes and [fears](/public-speaking-and-living-with-fear)?
  - What is my purpose?
  - Where do I want to see myself in one year, five years, ten years?

I loved the transitions that were built into college life.  I would work hard on several courses for a few months and find my rhythm. Then I'd get a hiatus, followed by new courses, routines and people.

Professional life can be just the opposite.  Some of us work the same job, the same routines for a decade or more.

I'd argue that staying in the same position for more than five years is no longer the way to play the career game (but that's a topic for another post).

The world is changing quickly.

Life's too short to stay stagnant, routine or safe.  

And besides, we are built for [change](/change). Just like nature.

**Transition is a wonderful reminder to reflect, renew and grow.**
