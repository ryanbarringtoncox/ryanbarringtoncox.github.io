Some people won't introduce themselves to you or ask your name.

For some reason, they expect you to make the first move and come to them.  It took me a long time to realize that I could be one of these people.

I've had things get awkward and tense because another person and I both refused to introduce ourselves and ask the other person's name.  After you're around somebody for months or years even, it gets harder and harder to do. It can get uncomfortable.

**Now I just introduce myself first.  By default.  Why risk another Cold War Standoff?**

It's been a great habit to get into.  It's gotten me out of my shell and connected me to more people.

People sincerely appreciate the gesture.  We feel important when someone takes the time to initiate connection, learn our name (and hopefully remember it, but that's another post for another day).

Life has improved since I started introducing myself first.
