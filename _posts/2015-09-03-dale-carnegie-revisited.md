[Dale Carnegie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Carnegie) was born into a poor Missouri farming family in 1888.

Dale grew into a successful, accomplished man by realizing that the majority of our success depends on how well we communicate and relate to others. Lucky for us, these qualities can be learned and practiced if we are willing to get off our asses and grow.

**Dale's definition of success depends heavily on empathy, understanding and connection.**

Here are some of my favorite Carnegie quotes.
\\
\\
“If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”
\\
\\
“The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition.”
\\
\\
“People rarely succeed at anything unless they have fun doing it."
\\
\\
“To be interested, be interesting. Ask questions that other people enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments.”
\\
\\
“The unvarnished truth is that almost all people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance, and recognize it sincerely.” 
\\
\\
“Remember, we all crave appreciation and recognition, and will do almost anything to get it. But nobody wants insincerity. Nobody wants flattery."
\\
\\
"You Can’t Win an Argument... If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent’s good will.” 
\\
\\
“The only reason that you are not a rattlesnake is your mother and father are not rattlesnakes… You deserve very little credit for being what you are - and remember, the people who come to you irritated, bigoted, unreasoning, deserve very little discredit for being what they are.” 
\\
\\
**“Three-fourths of the people you will ever meet are thirsting for sympathy. Give it to them and they will love you.”** 
\\
\\
These quotes are from Dale's 1936 book, *How to Win Friends and Influence People.* You can read my notes on this book [here](/book-notes/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people).
