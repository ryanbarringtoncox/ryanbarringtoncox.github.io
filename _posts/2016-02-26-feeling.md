title: Feeling
---
I got into music as a teenager because it made me feel so many things intensely. Alone in my room, I could experience a wide smattering of emotions - joy, pain, laughter, shame and love.

As I get older, my schedule and my mind get cluttered.  Failures try to numb me.  It's easy to feel things less and less as an adult.

**I want to feel.**

I love writing these posts, telling stories and jokes to people. I love making music.  I do these things because of the feelings associated with them.

I have a busy brain and it gets in the way sometimes.

Feeling is where it's at.
