Our three-year-old is starting to dress herself.

Some garments slip on easily.  Others are more difficult.

There are times when she gets stuck with her arms and head inside a dark clothes--net and can't free herself. Oh no!

If she freaks out, thrashes around and panics, she's done for.  The net gets tighter.

If she takes a deep breath, stays calm and keeps her wits about her, she stays in control.  This increases her chances of solving the dilemma at hand.

The life lesson that I'm trying to teach her?

**Be cool.**

**Keep calm.**

**Panic makes it worse.**

Now I just need to take my own advice.
