"Do I contradict myself?  Very well then. I contradict myself. I am large. I contain multitudes." - Walt Whitman

I love [tracking](/time-tracking), [focusing](/focus) and [learning](/four-levels-of-learning).  I delve into these ideas, enjoy them and gain new perspectives. It feels right.

**Ideas give me zeal.**

Periodically, when I feel bored, tired or limited by an idea, I discard it.  I may come back to it.  I may not.

Ideas can set us free **or** confine us.  I yearn to continually renew.

It starts with ideas.

Sometimes I'll find harmony with the opposite of what I've been doing. I let myself be unfocused and undisciplined for a while or start learning something and quit.  This feels right too.

Contrast is powerful.  In art, music and yes, even in learning.

**Sometimes stopping and hitting reverse is just what the doctor ordered.**

Changing current ideas regularly keeps it fresh.  This is alternating current.

  - Try one idea.
  - Stop.
  - Do the opposite.
  - Repeat.

Come back to an idea only if it becomes enticing or useful again.  There is not need to commit to ideas.

Am I contradicting myself in these posts?

Have I failed to make sense?

That's because I contain multitudes.

And so do you.
