[Dale Carnegie]({{ site.url }}/dale-carnegie-revisited) says we all crave respect.

Once our basic needs (food, shelter, water) are met, we need respect.  It's our fundamental nature, what sets apart from the animals.

With that in mind,

  - who do you respect?
  - who respects you?
  - how do you show respect to others?

These are worthwhile questions to ponder.
