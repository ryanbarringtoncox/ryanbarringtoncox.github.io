How will you feel afterwards?

Cheap buffet food may feel good going down, but how do you feel afterwards?  I feel sleepy, bloated, greasy and gross.  For hours.  Totally not worth it for the fifteen minutes of pleasure.

After I exercise I generally feel optimistic, energized and confident.  That feeling lasts hours as well.

So...

Have another drink?

Go for a run in the rain?

Go back to school to get the degree?

Pull an all-nighter to get caught up?

Unload and say a bunch of mean stuff to somebody you love?

Should you do them or not?

Well... how will you feel afterwards?
