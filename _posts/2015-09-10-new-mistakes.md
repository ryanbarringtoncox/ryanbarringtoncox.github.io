I've made several new mistakes in the last week.

Immediately after making these mistakes, I was upset, wishing I had handled the situations differently.

"If only I could redo it and do it right!" I told myself. As is often the case, I was better prepared *after* the fact. And that's the whole point.

**It takes a new mistake to know what to do next time.**

These new mistakes came from new unprecedented challenges, new scenarios.  Each new mistake came about because I had ventured into unchartered, risky waters.

Now that I've had time to process and mourn, I'm grateful for the opportunity to make new mistakes.

New mistakes give me new perspective.

**New mistakes mean I'm growing down the right path.**

Come to think of it, I can't imagine learning much *without* new mistakes.  It's one thing to be told.  It's another to [taste the pavement]({{ site.url }}/failure) myself.

Please note: I'm not advocating that we make the same mistakes again and again. I'm advocating for *new* mistakes. The distinction is everything.

I'm betting every successful person has a series of "new" mistakes under their belt.

Let's raise our glasses to new mistakes and give thanks.

To my email subscribers:  Speaking of mistakes, I just realized that relative links (links to pages within my site) have been broken via email. Oops!  They should be working now ([testing?!]({{ site.url }}/book-notes)).  If anything seems broken, please "reply" and let me know.  I'd like to know about my mistakes asap, thanks!
