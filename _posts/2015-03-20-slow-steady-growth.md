I've tended to want it all too soon.  To be the best programmer, speaker, songwriter I can be as quickly as possible.

Now I don't see a problem with being ambitious or wanting to achieve great things.  Just the opposite.  However, hitting it too hard can lead to disappointment, burnout or even injury.

A few years ago, an entrepreneur friend told me that his goal is "slow, steady growth."  This notion was counter to my thinking at the time, but it stuck with me.  It sounded wise.

A couple years later, his words ring true.

The race is long.

To be ambitious but not greedy.

To set a pace that I can keep for decades.

To keep slow, steady growth in mind.

This is how I'll hone my craft.
