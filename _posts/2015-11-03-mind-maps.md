We can use [mind maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) to organize information visually.

Mind maps work well for note-taking, day-dreaming, brainstorming and assimilating new ideas.

I've been mind-mapping my thoughts on marriage, storytelling and test strategies lately and getting some interesting results.

**Mind maps help me understand the relationships within the big picture.**

I tend to retain more after I mind-map. It's a [fun]({{site.url}}/enthusiasm) approach to problem-solving.

Next time you want to solve a problem, mind-map it. Then [do something else]({{site.url}}/plunge-in-and-quit) while your subconscious chews on it.
