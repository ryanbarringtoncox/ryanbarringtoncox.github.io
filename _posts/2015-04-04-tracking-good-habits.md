I wrote about [tracking bad habits](/tracking-bad-habits) yesterday.  Here's the companion piece.

Tracking good habits works just as well.  I keep a spreadsheet that tracks my number of hours slept and whether I meditated, exercised or ate well the day before.  It only takes a few seconds to enter in my stats each morning.

This might sound crazy, but it has changed my life.  The daily ritual of recording these numbers has helped me become a lot healthier.  I can also see trends and relationships.  It's good to have data on yourself.

Hours slept was the most recent addition to the list.  Late last year, I was having awful insomnia, sometimes only sleeping four or five hours a night.  It was ruining my life. Once I started writing down hours slept, my sleep patterns fell in line within weeks.  I still have the occasional sleepless night but they are much rarer now.

Often times, we think we are improving, but we're not really sure.  The past can become a blur.  Tracking a small number of good habits daily can change your life.

If this resonates with you, try tracking your essential habits, good and bad.
