title: Chance
---
Take a chance.\\
\\
Do something scary.\\
\\
Venture out on a limb\\
without expectation.\\
\\
Make a joke.\\
\\
Start a blog.\\
\\
Apply for a job\\
that pays double.\\
\\
Tell someone\\
you appreciate them\\
(or better yet\\
you love them)\\
\\
There's fruit\\
at the edges\\
of comfort,\\
apples in\\
chance.\\
\\
Reach out.\\
\\
Pluck one.
