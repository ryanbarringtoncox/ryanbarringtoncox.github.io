Can you sit, watch your breath and keep from getting distracted?  For how long?

It's not easy to do.  Try it.  There is so much chatter going on in our heads all the time.

It's interesting to sit and count breaths and watch the thoughts come and go.  Doing this for a while yields some very interesting results.

You are not necessarily your thoughts.  Watching the breath helps us to become aware of that.
