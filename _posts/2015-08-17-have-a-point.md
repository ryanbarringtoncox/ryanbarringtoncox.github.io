**Have a point.  A point fits neatly into one concise sentence.**

Having a simple point is harder than it sounds.  We meander down tangents all too often.

Have you ever heard a speaker talk for an hour and left with no sense of what their point was?

We want to go with you so please...  keep it simple.  Have a point.

That's my point.
