When we're feeling frustrated, let's stop what we're doing and step back.

**Quality work isn't born from frustrated hands.**

When I get into a process, get frustrated and keep pushing, my work suffers.  My health suffers.  I usually have to redo the work later anyway.

*Ugh.*

At the first sign of frustration -

  1.  Stop doing.
  2.  Breathe.
  3.  Walk around.
  4.  Figure out a new approach.  Or ask yourself if it needs to be done now (or at all).  If all else fails, sleep on it.

Frustration is unhealthy and unproductive.  Nip it in the bud.
