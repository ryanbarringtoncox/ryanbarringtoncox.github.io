Steve Jobs on learning to program:

*"We used it as a way to mirror our thought process. I think everyone should learn how to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think. I view computer science as a liberal art, something everyone should learn to do."*

I love that quote from Steve Jobs.

The focus, logic and mental-modeling that I've learned from programming has created positive ripples throughout my life. 

Programming is about process and thinking in different ways.

There are an infinite number of ways to approach a problem.  How many can you think of?  What are the pros and cons of each?

Programming lights up different parts of your brain and sparks creativity.

Ever get stuck in one way of thinking and wear yourself out? Programming reminds me again to step back, re-think the problem and  re-approach.

I have no idea if I'll be writing code in forty years, but I do know that the investment I've made in programming will still be paying off.

If you have an interest in learning to program, go for it.  There's never been an easier time.  [Codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com) is one of many great resources online today.
