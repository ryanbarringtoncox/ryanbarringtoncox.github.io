I overheard someone use a popular expression the other day.  He said, "Don't reinvent the wheel."

Do our cars roll on wooden medieval wagon wheels?

Do our bicycles have rock cylinders?

The reinvention of the wheel is one of the only things we've consistently done well millions of times.  It's called progress.

Why are we picking on wheels?  Nobody says, "Don't reinvent the pulley."
