What’s the one thing I want to get done today?

This is the kind of self-talk I’m working on right now.  **Forget multitasking.  Do one thing and kick ass at it.**  Doing one thing well every day adds up to more accomplishments than switching between several things throughout the day.

It takes energy and time to switch contexts.  To cache.  To find a new flow.

Go deeper with fewer.

**Pick something.**

**Focus.**

**Go.**

This post is just about one thing.  That’s it.
