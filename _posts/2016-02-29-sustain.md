It can take years, even decades, to master a craft.  When the newness wears off, we may have to be bad for a long time.  It's no wonder most of us don't make it over the long haul.

How do I keep from burning out and set a sustain pace?

  - Have fewer ambitions.  Do less better.  Focus on [a few things]({{site.url}}/now) that matter most.
  - Set measurable goals (i.e. 3-month, 1-year, 10-year).  It's okay to change them later.
  - [Renew]({{site.url}}/renew).
  - Celebrate accomplishments.

I've been blogging and speaking publicly for under two years now.  It's exciting to think about where I'll be after fives years, a decade of exploring these crafts.

**Setting a sustainable pace is key.**
