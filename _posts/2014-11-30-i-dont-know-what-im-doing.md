I know how to do more things today than any other day of my life.  I’m also more aware than ever of all the things I don’t know how to do.

**As I learn more, I see more and more that I don't know.  My humility grows.**

In the past, I tried to hide it when I didn’t know what I was doing.  I’d get defensive and try to convince people that I knew things I didn’t.

Why run from it?

Why not just admit it?

“Hey, I don’t know what I’m doing!  Acknowledged.  Great.  Now let's get started figuring it out, learning, moving forward.”

We're all lost a lot of the time.

That’s how it should be.

That's how it always will be.

Admit it.

Figure it out.

Move on to the next thing.

**I'm noticing that the sharpest people around me don’t hesitate to fess up when they don’t know what’s going on.**  These folks have helped me realize that noticing and admitting when I’m lost is a strength, not a weakness.
