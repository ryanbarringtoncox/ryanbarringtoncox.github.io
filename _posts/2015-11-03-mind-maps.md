[Mind maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) are a visual way to organize information.  Mind maps work well for note-taking, day-dreaming, brainstorming and assimilating new ideas.

I've been mind-mapping new test strategies lately and getting some great results. They bring order on a subconscious level.

Next time you want to solve a problem, consider mind-mapping it and [doing something else]({{site.url}}/plunge-in-and-quit).
