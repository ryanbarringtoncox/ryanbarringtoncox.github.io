[James Bach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Marcus_Bach) is a software tester, author and speaker.  There are several excellent [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAhJf36_u5U) of his presentations online. James may be abrasive but his ideas are top notch.

I was especially smitten by James' **Five Levels of Learning**.  James breaks the learning process down into five subsequent levels.  Here are my notes on James' five Levels.

###Level 1: I overcame obliviousness.

I now realize there is something here to learn.

###Level 2: I overcame intimidation.

I feel I can learn this skill.  I know enough that I am not intimidated by people who know more than me. I don't get backed into a corner when I'm talking to others who know more.

###Level 3: I overcame incoherence.

I no longer feel I am pretending or hand-waving.  I can discuss competently and sound like I know what Iâ€™m saying.

###Level 4: I overcame competence.

I am productively self-critical.  I want to take risks, invent, teach and push myself.  I want to be around other enthusiastic students.

---------

I love James' breakdown of learning levels.  I've seen these patterns at work in my life.  

Getting over intimidation may be the hardest level for me. I suspect I am not alone there.

**Learning is a journey from realization to risk.**
