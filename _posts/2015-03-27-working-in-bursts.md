You may have noticed that I've been posting every day.  This started on the 19th with a post about [Failure](/failure).

I had gotten out of the habit of writing regularly, and the longer I waited the more daunting the task became.  I tried a few pieces but couldn't get the right feel.

I needed a new approach so I decided to write something short and small every day for a week, even if I didn't think it was up to par.

**I made a commitment to have a quick burst of writing each morning before starting my day.**

Nine days later, the well couldn't be wetter.  Making the choice to write daily and keep the pieces shorter has tapped into a new stream of creativity.

Sometimes we just need to keep the frequency up.

Don't wait for the perfect idea or opportunity.

Don't over-analyze.

**Just.  Create.**

Set a ritual and do a little bit every day.

Once I started writing daily, I started seeing ideas everywhere.  The well is deep and it's all around us if we listen, pay attention and describe what we're seeing and feeling honestly.

It's a pleasure and a privilege to filter these ideas through me.  No telling how long the streak will last, but I hope you're enjoying some of these short pieces in the mean time!
