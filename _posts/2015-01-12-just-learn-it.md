I’ve been avoiding learning a certain software application.  It’s an older app and I didn’t bother learning it because it’ll likely be phased out soon.

Over the last few months, I’ve rationalized my avoidance and talked about it.  I’ve found numerous workarounds to not learn this piece of software.

This software application is still used widely at my job though. It hasn't gone away over the past year.

Today I realized that I’ve spent hours avoiding it, talking about it, weighing the pros against the cons.  I finally just googled a tutorial and spent an hour getting familiar with the app.  Now I’m using it (I'm not a pro by any means, but I am up and running).

Yet another reminder to step back and try a different approach. **It often takes more effort to avoid something than to dive in and learn it.**
