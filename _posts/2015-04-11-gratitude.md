It's important to be grateful.  Being grateful creates a higher quality of life and shapes our experiences.

**We can choose our perspectives, and our perspectives defines our reality.**

Being grateful brings more good things to us (including more gratefulness).   I've seen it at work in my own life.  When I'm grateful and appreciative, things are on the up and up. There is a certain energy at play.

Conversely, being negative and complaining brings us down.  Bitch and moan long enough and you'll find yourself surrounded by other bitchers and moaners.  Opportunities shrink away.  Digging out of that trench can be quite a challenge.  I know. I've been there.

We all get down sometimes and it's healthy to be humble and self-deprecate from time to time.  I'm trying to balance humility by keeping gratitude in mind, having more [intent](/intent) towards being grateful for what I have.

Put your gratitude out into the world today.  Acknowledge the good things.

What are you grateful for?
