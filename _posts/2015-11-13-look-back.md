title: Look Back
---
*"If you get into the habit of (looking back), you will acquire some knowledge well ordered and ready to use, and you will develop your ability of solving problems." - George Polya*

[How to Solve It]({{site.url}}/book-notes/how-to-solve-it) is a lovely little book about solving problems.  The author, George Polya, encourages us to *enjoy* solving problems.

Solving problems is like riding a bike or playing the piano, says Polya.  We learn through imitation and practice.

Polya lays out a four-step method to solve problems.

  1. Understand the problem (seems obvious, but too often we dive in without fully understanding what we're trying to do).
  2. Devise a plan
  3. Carry out the plan
  4. Look back

Step #4, "Look Back," has been resonating heavily with me.  I keep busy and (hopefully) productive, but too often, I leap from one activity to the next, without repose.

**It's counterproductive to *do* activities without stopping, [pausing]({{site.url}}/pause) and looking back.**

"Looking back" is vital to my progress.  After I work on a problem, I should take time to look back and examine -

  - The method(s) I used
  - How I approached the problem
  - What I learned
  - Other ways I could have reached the same conclusion 
  - Other potential conclusions


Looking back makes lessons stick.

Today I'll pause after each activity and look back carefully before I step forward.
