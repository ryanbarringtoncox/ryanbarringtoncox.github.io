I've started posting [jokes]({{site.url}}/wolf).

Writing jokes is a new challenge.  The hardest part about posting them here is I can't use body language, inflection or timing to make them funny.

There are so many elements that go into good stand-up comedy. Delivery is crucial.  Still, you have to have good material.  You have to have well-written jokes!

I'm writing and posting jokes here, not because I think they're great, but to challenge myself and explore a new medium. 

More jokes to come.

They'll get better.

I'm not joking.

You'll see.
