I owe my successes to enthusiasm and my failures to apathy.

When I'm enthusiastic I find it easier to focus, to lose my sense of time and go the extra mile.  This leads to higher quality work.

When I'm disinterested or I don't care about a job, it's extremely difficult to produce quality results, no matter how much time I put in.

There are always off-days where I'm tired and unfocused, but I can't afford to be unenthusiastic for long.

Life is too short to waste on apathy.

It's too short to pretend that I care (when I don't).

Let's keep an eye on our enthusiasm and move closer to the work that inspires it.
