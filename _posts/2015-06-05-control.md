We strive for control.  Most us anyway.

Are we ever fully in control?

I think not.

Complete control is an illusion, something no one achieves.  I’m grateful for that.

To some degree, we are tossed about by life’s waves.  The best things in life often emerge from outside our planning and our desires.

Yes, of course I want to have *some* control over my health, relationships and career. We *do* have some control and that's not to be taken lightly.

At a certain point though, there are diminishing returns.  We push harder for control and get little or nothing back.

**In some cases, grasping for control leads to less control.**

Have you ever tried too hard to control something and made it worse?

Let’s not kid ourselves.  We’ll never be in full control of our lives. That’s a good thing.

**Let's make plans and better ourselves. Let's leave room for happy accidents too.**
