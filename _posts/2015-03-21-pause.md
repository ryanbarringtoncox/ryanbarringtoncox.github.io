When speaking, pause often. Give the other person a chance to absorb what you've said.  Give them a chance to speak too.

When playing music, put a healthy dose of space between the notes.  That's what Miles Davis did.

Don't prepare your next bite while you're chewing your food.

Pause.

Experience it.

After completing a task, pause.  Reflect before proceeding to the next task.

It's a challenge to keep things from overlapping too much and thus losing their definition.

Don't let life blur you by.
