title: Blowing Smoke

Why is flattery synonymous with blowing smoke up one's ass?

"You're doing a great job around the office, Bill, and I'm *not* just blowing smoke up your ass.  Because you'd like that - if I dumped out the paper shredder, lit the scraps on fire, got some thick smoke going, took a leather pair of bellows, drew in the smoke and blew it right up your ass."

"That would be flattery, Bill, and I'm merely saying you're doing a great job around the office."
