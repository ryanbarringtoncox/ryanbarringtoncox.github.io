title: Writing is Projecting
layout: post

These posts are a projection of who I want to be.  I aim to flex my best side, cultivate awareness and practice new ways of thinking.

I see a trend in recent posts -

  1. Something nags/rattles/challenges me.
  2. I search for the meaning in it.
  3. I write about it here to distill a lesson, to learn something new and grow.

Iâ€™m not always as clear-headed and on-point as I may appear here. These posts are a barometer for who I want to be.

How can we improve ourselves if we don't know who we want to be?

Writing is a trajectory towards a meaningful, empowered life.

Writing is projecting who I want to be.
