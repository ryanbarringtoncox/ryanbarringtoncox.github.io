How much stability do you crave?  What brings it?

Owning a home, being insured, having money in the bank, job security, love?

It's good to have stability.  No doubt.  We all want to feel safe and assured.

All things in moderation though. We'll never achieve 100% stability.  There will always be unknowns.

Needing too much stability can be a handicap, an unattainable burden, an unwillingness to lean in to risk. 

**Risk is the opposite of stability and risk can bring handsome rewards.**

Stability is a wonderful thing, but let's beware of choosing it too often. Fate often rewards the bold, the risk-takers.

Finding the balance between stability and risk is a personal quest.  We might even call that our destiny.
