I'm less defensive now than I used to be, but I still see defensiveness in me sometimes.

It's helpful to be aware of defensiveness and how it feels in my body.

My muscles get tighter.

My breath gets shallower.

I start to resist that which is making me defensive.

I can't think of a scenario where these symptoms are helpful.  I don't have to agree with everything that happens, and yes, it's vital to defend myself at times.

**Ironically, defensiveness doesn't help me defend myself.  It makes me weaker.**

Keeping myself relaxed and breathing deeply leads to a more well-defended, future-proof me.

Welcoming criticism helps too.  I don't have to be right all the time.  It's good to be [challenged](/people-who-challenge-us).

Rookies get defensive.  Pros [hang loose](/hang-loose).
