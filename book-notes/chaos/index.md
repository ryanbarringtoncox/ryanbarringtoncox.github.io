### My Notes 

*A work in progress - RC 12/24/2015.*

### The Butterfly Effect

Chaos emerges as a new approach to science in the latter half of the 20th century.\\
\\
"Yes, you could change the weather.  You could make it do something different from what it would otherwise have done.  But if you did, then you would never know what it would otherwise have done.  It would be like giving an extra shuffle to an already well-shuffled pack of cards.  You know it will change your luck, but you don't know whether for better or worse."\\
\\
Lorenz's computer simulation of the weather showed that it's impossible to predict the weather more than a few days ahead because of **The Butterfly Effect.**  The Butterfly Effect happens when a tiny input change results in large output change.  The weather is an example of non-linear behavior.\\
\\
**It my be counterintuitive, but small changes in input don't necessarily result in small changes in output.**\\
\\
Computer programs exhibit the Butterfly Effect.  For example, when floating point calculations round off a few tiny decimals, that small change can propagate through the system and cause wildly different output.\\
\\
The Butterfly Effect shows up when heating fluids.  Apply some heat and the fluid starts rolling in cycles.  Add more heat, and the rolls start to wobble.  At very high temperatures, "the flow becomes wild and turbulent."  Again, this is non-linearity at work.\\
\\
Graphs of this chaotic Butterfly Effect behavior may show beautiful, complex patterns.  **There is order within chaos.**  Google "Lorenz Attractor" and see for yourself.

### Revolution

Chaos Theory was shunned by most 20th century scholars.  Chaos threatens all that they have built there careers upon.\\
\\
Science has traditionally ignored small nonlinearities (i.e. friction, air resistance), to keep the equations and calculations simple and understandable.  The Butterfly Effect shows that neglecting small nonlinearities can cause the science to be drastically wrong.\\
\\
Simple oscillators such as swings and pendulums can exhibit wild, unpredictable behavior.\\
\\
What does "stable" mean?  Can chaotic systems exhibit some sense of stability, if viewed in a useful way?\\
\\
Smale studies dynamic systems, topology and dynamic systems.  By analyzing oscillators in their phase space, he sees beautiful patterns.\\
\\
**The mysterious swirling Great Red Spot of Jupiter is explained through Chaos Theory.**  Marcus programs a computer simulation of the spot in "small-scale chaotic flow."\\
\\
"Marcus learned that a deterministic system can produce much more than just periodic behavior.  He knew to look for wild disorder, and he knew that  islands of structure could appear within the disorder.  So he brought the problem of the Great Red Spot an understanding that a complex system can give rise to turbulence and coherence at the same time.  He could work within an emerging discipline that was creating its own tradition of using the computer as an experimental tool."

### Life's Ups and Downs

Scientists learn not to see chaos, because it disagrees with their need to predict and understand things.\\
\\
"A man leaves the house in the morning thirty seconds late, a flowerpot misses his head by a few millimeters, and then he is run over by a truck.  Or less dramatically, he misses a bus that runs every ten minutes - his connection to a train that runs every hour. Small perturbations in one's daily trajectory can have large consequences...  Science, though - science was different."\\
\\
Chaotic patterns emerge in population growth and decline.\\
\\
Some populations rise and fall less and less over time, until they reach an equilibrium with their environment.\\
\\
Other systems grow until they become chaotic and then split in two.  The resulting **bifurcations** grow until they become chaotic and split again.  We see the periods keep doubling - 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.\\
\\
Population biology and ecology exhibit similar periods.  Bizarre behavior like this exists throughout nature, which is full of nonlinear systems.

### A Geometry of Nature

An eccentric guy named Mandelbrot dabbles in many fields - economics, mathematics, game theory, etc - and brings a unique approach to each.\\
\\
Working at IBM, Mandelbrot analyzes the noise in telephone lines.  What is the pattern?  He sees a [Cantor Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set), a pattern that repeats itself throughout different scales (but may confuse us when we are stuck in one view scale).\\
\\
Mandelbrot discovers irregularities in the distance of country's borders.  **He shows that "any coastline is - in a sense - infinitely long.  In another sense, the answer depends on the length of your ruler."** As you go to finer and finer scales, there is more and more distance to measure.  Think about this for a few minutes.  It's mind-blowing.\\
\\
Mandelbrot discovers that all objects, even the simplest attributes of texture and shape, depend on our scale of observance.  What shape is your car from five feet away?  From five thousand feet away?\\
\\
Mandelbrot creates the word "Fractal" and shows us an infinitely small line can fit in a finite space.  Our lungs are like fractals.  Lots of surface area packed into a small area.\\
\\
**"Scale is important."** Very important.  Think about the universe all the way down to atoms.  There is complexity and beauty at every scale.\\
\\
Self-similarity is an old concept. It means at any scale, the part resembles the whole.  Clouds are self-similar.\\
\\
Simple equations can cause endless complex, beautiful patterns.\\
\\
**"Art that satisfies lacks scale, in the sense that it contains important elements at all sizes.""**
