After three years of wanting to do stand-up comedy (and being too [scared]({{site.url}}/fear-of-disapproval)), I did an open mic last night.  

Did I crush it and get tons of laughs?

Of course not.  It was my first time.

I did get a few chuckles though, and it was fun observing other comedians' styles.

Three observations -

  1. Most of the laughs I got came from spontaneity, responding to the crowd or silence.  Very few came from what I'd written in advance.\\
  *Lesson: Be present, get out of your head, don't over-memorize and have fun.*
  2. I enjoyed the comedians who used [fewer words]({{site.url}}/say-less) and more [pauses]({{site.url}}/pause).  Some jokes only become funny after a second or two of silence.\\
  *Lesson: Less is more.  Let it breathe. If you try to say everything, you'll say nothing.*
  3. The funniest comedians reenacted their [stories]({{site.url}}/stories) in real time.  They became characters, did voices, etc.\\
  *Lesson: Show don't tell.*

**Comedy may be the greatest performance art we have because it's about joy, laughter and connection.**

When comedy works, the whole room comes together.  When it doesn't, the silence is brutal and [humiliating]({{site.url}}/humiliation).  What a great opportunity to [fail fast]({{site.url}}/failure)!

I want to bring more humor into my every day life and gain a greater awareness of social rhythm, tension and release.  I want people to enjoy me.

I'm looking forward to my next stand-up open mic.
