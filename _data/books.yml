- title: How to Win Friends and Influence People - by Dale Carnegie
  url: how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people
  teaser: Yes, the title sounds evil and manipulative, but hang on a minute!  This 1936 classic may be the best self-help book of all time.  Help yourself by helping others. This book should be titled "How to be Empathetic" or "How to Communicate Kindly."

- title: An Introduction to General Systems Thinking - by Gerald M. Weinberg
  url: an-introduction-to-general-systems-thinking 
  teaser: This 1975 book grew from Weinberg's popular college course on General Systems Theory.  The course didn't fit into any department (perhaps it was too "general").  This book is full of insights, thought experiments and poetic nuggets like "If we want to learn anything, we mustn’t try to learn everything."

- title: Tools of Critical Thinking - by David A. Levy
  url: tools-of-critical-thinking
  teaser: How often do we think about how we think?  This book explores metathinking and highlights common pitfalls and workarounds.

- title: The Art of Unix Programming - by Eric S. Raymond 
  url: the-art-of-unix-programming 
  teaser: Unix was built on virtues of elegance, simplicity and versatility.  This book describes Unix coding philosophy in detail and is *probably* only for hackers (prove me wrong non-hackers!).  "Constructive laziness is one of the cardinal virtues of the master programmer.” - Raymond

- title: The Art of Software Testing - by Glenford J Myers
  url: the-art-of-software-testing
  teaser: Software testing is a relatively new field.  Few people agree on how to do it "right."  Some consider this book to be a classic on the subject.  It's brief, general and not tied to any particular trend or technology.
