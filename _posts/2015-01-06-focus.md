Focus may be the most valuable skill to master today.  We are bombarded with information.  The options are limitless.  We live in an ADD-inducing world.

Still, we have to get shit done.

I’ve struggled with focus.  As a kid, I found it hard to focus on books without getting distracted.  Even today, I’ll start reading documentation and before I know it (unconsciously!), I’ve opened up a new browser tab and started checking my email or Facebook again.  

**Keeping focused isn’t always easy, but it’s worth the investment.**

I need focus to push through difficulty to completion.  That’s how I learn and grow.

We all know the person who starts a million projects but never gets anything done.

Mastery doesn’t happen easily or by itself.

So what can I do to increase my focus?

  1.  Decide beforehand what I’m going to work on and be vigilant.  Time tracking tasks helps with this.
  2.  Keep in mind the one thing I want to accomplish today and do it first. It's better to finish one thing 100% than partially complete eight things.
  3.  Turn off email, text messages and Facebook.  Clear the environment of clutter.
  4.  Forgive myself when I fail.

Line up the balls, then...

Hack it.

Hit it.

Go!
