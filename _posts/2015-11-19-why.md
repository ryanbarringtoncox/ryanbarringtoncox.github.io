title: Why?

*This post describes an approach to writing technical reports, inspired by [James Bach](http://www.satisfice.com/aboutjames.shtml).  Wait, don't stop reading!  It can be applied to any type of expression.*

When reporting, state [your point]({{site.url}}/have-a-point) right away.

If someone reads only the first sentence, they should get something.

Next, expand your point. Those who keep reading will get more details as they delve deeper.

As you're writing, imagine a dialogue in your head.  Ask "Why?" after each sentence.

Why?

You must always consider your reader's point of view because they don't know the subject as well as you.

Why not?

You have delved into the depths of the subject. Your reader has not. Too often, writing lacks narrative flow and alienates the common reader.

Why care about the common reader?

Reporting is meaningless if it isn't communicated well.

**Most technical documents are verbose and poorly written.**

Keep to the [simple]({{site.url}}/simplicity), especially when writing about the technical.

  1. State your point right away.
  2. Expand.
  3. Question each sentence.

[Questioning]({{site.url}}/question-yourself) comes naturally to little kids. It's also a fundamental component of the Socratic Method.

**Why argue with little kids and Socrates?**
