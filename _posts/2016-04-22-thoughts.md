Swaddling a baby is like tying up a screaming elderly man, against his will and he loves it.

Before you spank your kid, remember: They will choose your nursing home.

What do you call leftover refried beans that have been reheated on the stove?

My neck hurts because I slept funny.  My grandfather died in his sleep so he must've slept hilarious. 

A kid on a scooter has the world in his hands.  A grown man on a scooter has a DUI. 

Have you ever been in a room all alone and thought, "Did I fart?"

If life is a bowl of cherries, death is a basket of chicken wings.
