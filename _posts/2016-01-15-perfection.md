I don't want perfection.

Meaningful, quality work comes from chasing passion, not perfection.

Notes to self.

  - Don't re-write material too many times.
  - Keep it fresh.
  - Keep evolving.
  - Keep it coming.
  - **Work hard on what gives me energy** (and be mindful of what depletes me).

Even if perfection *were* possible, I wouldn't want it.
