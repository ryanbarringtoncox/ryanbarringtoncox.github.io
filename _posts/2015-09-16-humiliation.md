Nothing burns quite like humiliation.

Humiliation hurts, stays with you. You taste it.

Play it safe, keep your head low and you may avoid humiliation.

Venture out of your comfort zone and humiliation may bite.

**Why avoid humiliation?**

You can learn more from humiliation than most college courses.

Humiliation is red, raw and direct. She's talking to you. Listen.

Tell a humiliating story after some time has passed and it's funny.

Go and gather up some humiliation.

**Humiliation ages like wine.**
