I'll be competing in a [Speech Contest](http://www.toastmasters.org/Leadership-Central/Speech-Contests) next month. I started writing the speech last week.

I'm relatively new to speech-writing, having only started a year ago. However, I've been [writing songs for over twenty years](https://ryanbarringtoncox.bandcamp.com/).  **I'm pleased to tell you that there is plenty of overlap between speech-writing and songwriting.** 

I don’t claim to be an expert on this topic, but I did win [3rd place in a statewide humorous speech competition](https://mountainx.com/blogwire/asheville-toastmasters-club-436-members-take-prizes-in-nc-district-competition/) last Fall.  I tell you this for credibility, not to brag.

Below are some tips that have helped me write speeches.  I plan to work them into my upcoming speech.

1.  **Pick a topic that I can riff for longer than the speech length.**  If I have too much to say, then that’s a great starting point for a song or speech.  It’s easier to chisel away and remove from the topic than it is to add filler.  If I can say a lot, that means I'm excited about the topic and know something about it.
2.  **Have a point.**  If someone asks me, “What’s the point of your speech?” I should have a deliberate, concise answer.  Ever heard a speaker that rambles on for a long time and you have no idea what their point was afterwards?  Yeah, me too ; )
3.  **Always keep form in mind**.  A good speech generally has a beginning, a middle and an end.  A great speech usually wraps back around at the end and references something from the beginning, with a twist or new perspective. Contour matters.
4.  **The opening line has to draw in the audience**.  Do I start with a question, a joke, something absurd or unexpected?  This is a crucial moment to set the tone. First impressions count.
5.  **The last line has to bring it home**.  Hit hard at the end and leave an impression that stays with them.
6.  **Momentum.**  Once you hook them in the beginning, you have to keep it going.  The story has to stay interesting.  This means using rhythm, timing and twists.  It also means removing filler words and staying on point.
7.  **Hooks.** A simple, repetitive hook goes a long way.  This is true for Dananjaya Hettiarachchi's speech, ["I See Something"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbz2boNSeL0) and the Beatles' "Eight Days a Week."  Bringing back the same line, over and over, with new dimensions each time, is gold, baby. Gold.
8.  **Humor.**  Laughter feels good.  We all want to laugh.  Keeping them laughing is keeping them listening.  Ironically, the more intense the topic, the more humor helps.  I’m amazed by speakers who can pepper a death speech with laughter.  That’s contrast.  That’s art!
9.  **Choreography.**  Body language gives life to speech.  Movement sets the tone of your speech (for better or worse).  Video recording devices are cheap and prevalent these days.  Watching a recording of myself can be brutal but it helps.
10.  **Have fun.** Winning doesn't matter nearly as much as enjoying.  Life is short.  I'm honored to have the attention while I speak. Let's play.
11.  **Make it about them.**  A rookie mistake is focusing on yourself while you speak.  Focus on them.  Listen.  React.  Give them something they can enjoy.  The best gifts are the ones you give to others.
12.  **Be Direct.** It's better to connect than to use big words or long sentences.

These elements are prevalent in great songs and musical performances.  If I can get them working in my speech then I'll have a good shot at entertaining my audience, sharing my point of view and having fun.
