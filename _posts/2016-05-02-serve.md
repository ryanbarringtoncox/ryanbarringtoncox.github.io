What do they want?

Keeping this question in mind is the [great secret]({{site.url}}/book-notes/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people), one that I keep forgetting.

While speaking, programming or coming home to my family in the evening,

  - listen to what's needed and
  - fill that space.

Following my ego is hard work.

Listening to others and serving them is far more rewarding.
