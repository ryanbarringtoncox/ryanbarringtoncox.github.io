[Chen Man-Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheng_Man-ch%27ing) brought Tai Chi to the United States in the 1960s.

Man-Ching told his students to relax, especially in dire and dangerous circumstances.

Man-Ching taught relaxation  from a martial arts perspective.  When we are tense, we are stiff. Stiffness, allows our opponents to move and break us.

When we are relaxed, we are flexible. We channel the power of water which can smooth river stones and turn over large boats.

Man-Ching practiced Chinese medicine.  In his view, our bodies are full of energy channels.  When we are tense, our vital essence, chi, is blocked. Our energy can't flow naturally.  This is causes us to fall ill.

When we are relaxed, our chi flows freely. Relaxation gives us health and power. This may sound counterintuitive at first glance.

Relaxation is about *allowing* circumstances and ourselves to be as they are.

Relaxation is a simple concept and yet I find myself forgetting to relax all the time.

Our world is not a very relaxed place.

It's up to me to remember to stop.

Take a deep breath.

And relax.
