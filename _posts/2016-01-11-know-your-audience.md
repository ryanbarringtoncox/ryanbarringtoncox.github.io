title: Know Your Audience
---
I burned myself last week because I didn't give my audience enough consideration.  I assumed I would be speaking to a group of people who know me intimately.  I wrote something risky based on these assumptions.  Then I found myself speaking to a group of people who don't know me at all.  My exaggerations were misunderstood and my humor did not land well.

It would have gone smoother had I gauged the audience beforehand and asked myself these questions.

  - Who am I speaking to?
  - What do they want?
  - Are they with me?

I'll never know all the answers to these questions, but there is merit in asking them before *and* during a performance.

**I missed the opportunity to be present and change course based on audience response.**

I want to be more [aware]({{site.url}}/awareness-is-a-vessel) of others, *especially* when the spotlight is on me.

Note to self: Know your audience.
