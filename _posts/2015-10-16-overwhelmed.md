I get overwhelmed sometimes.

When I get overwhelmed, my mind darts erratically between to-dos. The ticking clock grows louder. Breathing shallows. Ligaments tense.

Itâ€™s worthwhile to [be aware]({{ site.url }}/awareness-is-a-vessel) of being overwhelmed.

**Like a bug on his back, legs twitching, energy wasting, I'm no good to anybody when I'm overwhelmed.**

When I'm overwhelmed, nothing gets done.  So I'll take a breath, take a break and bring my brain back to now.

[Hang loose]({{ site.url }}/hang-loose) and go from there.
