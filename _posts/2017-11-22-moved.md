Remember this blog?  I started it over three years ago, published [277 posts]({{site.url}}/posts) and a bunch of [notes]({{site.url}}/notes).

Whatever I was trying to do here, I did it. I think it was mostly meant to work out ideas and habits for me.  Now I've moved on to some new endeavors. The blog will remain here:

[http://ryanbarringtoncox.github.io/](http://ryanbarringtoncox.github.io/)

I may even keep posting from time to time.

Thanks for reading!
