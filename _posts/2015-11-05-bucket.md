Try to do everything and nothing gets done.

With that in mind, this bucket holds the things I will do before I die, but not right now.  You might even call it a bucket list.

  - Put out a unique [audio album or EP](https://ryanbarringtoncox.bandcamp.com/) every 2-3 years.  Ideas include:
    - A quick, no-nonsense iPhone-recorded "live album" of my favorite songs and bits
    - An electro-pop album, built on a computer that sounds nothing like my other albums
    - A mostly-live psych rock album with songs in "exotic" modes 
    - An album of songs that are arranged with only vocals and percussion.  No guitars, bass, keys, etc
  - Do more acts of public service (i.e. teach programming, music to kids, coach/help those in need, etc)
  - Interview more artists that inspire me
  - Tell a story on [The Moth](http://themoth.org/) and/or deliver a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks)
  - [Tai Chi]({{site.url}}/relax): Push hands again regularly and learn the sword form
  - Do further [research]({{site.url}}/book-notes) on things that inspire me like health, history, meditation, comedy, chaos, data visualization, survivalism, economics and investing.
  - Publish a book
