title: On Me
---
when I'm\\
struggling\\
to get along,\\
\\
that's\\
on me.\\
\\
when\\
there's\\
tension,\\
argument or\\
misunderstanding,\\
\\
that's on me too.\\
\\
blame is\\
a busted radio,\\
a broken record,\\
a black hole,\\
a forever\\
drain.\\
\\
i'm lucky\\
i'm not\\
a victim.\\
\\
my response\\
is on\\
me.
