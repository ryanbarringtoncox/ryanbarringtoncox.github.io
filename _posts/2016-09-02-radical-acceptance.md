tittle: Radical Acceptance

Some key takeaways from Zara Brach's wonderful book, *Radical Acceptance: Embracing Your Life with the Heart of a Buddha.*

  - Love yourself.
  - Forgive yourself and others.
  - We are all connected.  Helping others is helping yourself.
  - Pause and accept.  No need to react, say too much or add tension to difficult situations.
  - Come home to the body.  Make time *every day* to sit in stillness.  Watch the breath. Thoughts and feelings dance. Watch them without judgement.
  - Desire is part of the human condition.  It's normal to compare yourself to others, to want more than you have.  Be aware of desire and its tendency to bring suffering.
  - Be grateful for what you have.
  - Let things be.
