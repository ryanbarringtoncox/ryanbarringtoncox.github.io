I just read [Love and Logic](http://www.amazon.com/Parenting-Love-Logic-Updated-Expanded/dp/1576839540), a book on parenting.

Here are some things I want to remember from the book.

  - Never bluff.  Kids will call you on it.
  - Don't give multiple warnings. The "real world" doesn't.
  - Avoid control battles whenever possible.  If you must have one, win it.
  - **Be calm and loving.**  Don't threaten you kids.  (Do you like being threatened by your boss?)
  - **Give kids choices so they can learn to think for themselves and make their own decisions.**  This boosts confidence, independence and decision-making skills. Two choices is best.  The silent third choice is "You didn't decide so I will."
  - Let kids fail and experience their own natural consequences.  We learn through experience, not being told things.
  - Give kids as much control as they can handle, within reasonable boundaries.  As they grow, progressively widen those boundaries.  Teenagers, for example, should have a good deal of control over their lives, to prepare them for adulthood.
  - **Empathize with your kids.**  Rather than getting angry, feel their sorrow and pain when they make mistakes.  Talk to them and make sure they own their problems (unless they are in serious danger).
