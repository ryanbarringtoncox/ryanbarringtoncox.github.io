Reasons I enjoy performing comedy more than music:

  - Laughter
  - No load in
  - No sound check
  - No scheduling practices
  - No tuning up or changing strings
  - I get to be around other comedians (they think differently)
  - There's no ambiguity about whether shit is hitting or not
  - The rawness of having only your body and voice
  - No load out
