Music was my first calling, the first thing I went nuts over.  That was over twenty years ago.  I got hooked on Rock and then Folk and it was gathering no moss from there.

I spent most of my twenties writing and recording [music](http://ryanbarringtoncox.bandcamp.com) and playing in [bands](http://ifyouwannas.bandcamp.com/).  I could go on about that for a while, but that's not what I'm trying to say here.  Somewhere along the way I starting hacking around, trying to combine art and technology.  I got a job fixing vintage audio gear in Australia (and occasionally shocking myself), and then returned to the USA to work at [Moog Music](http://moogmusic.com). I stayed there four or five years and learned a lot about electronics and synthesizers.

In 2009, I fell into software as a lucky accident.  Itâ€™s been a huge blessing, a renaissance point in my life.  Thinking about software and algorithms has changed my way of thinking about everything - love, art, process, music - and I feel more excited than ever before.  Lately I find myself spending more time thinking about how to do things (rather than just diving in, doing them blind). Does that make sense?

Learning new processes, techniques and habits.  Evolving, bettering, trying to move forward with some tact.  That's what I'm trying to do here.  I hope you enjoy reading some of these posts.
