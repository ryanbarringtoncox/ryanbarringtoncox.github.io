- title: An Introduction to General Systems Thinking - by Gerald M. Weinberg
  url: an-introduction-to-general-systems-thinking 
  teaser: This 1975 book grew from Weinberg's popular college course on General Systems Theory.  The course didn't fit into any department (perhaps it was too "general").  It's revolutionized the way I think and is full of amazing insights, thought experiments, poetic quotes and nuggets like "If we want to learn anything, we mustn’t try to learn everything."

- title: How to Win Friends and Influence People - by Dale Carnegie
  url: how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people
  teaser: Yes, the title sounds evil and manipulative, but hang on a minute!  This 1936 classic is probably the best self-help book I've ever read. It should be titled "How to be Empathetic" or "How to Communicate Kindly."  Read the notes and find out for yourself. 

- title: The Art of Unix Programming - by Eric S. Raymond

  teaser: Unix chops are the Jedi skills of hacker culture. Unix was built on the virtues of elegance, simplicity and versatility.  This excellent book describes Unix coding practices in detail and is *probably* only for hackers (prove me wrong non-hackers!).  "Constructive laziness is one of the cardinal virtues of the master programmer.” - Raymond

- title: The Art of Software Testing - by Glenford J Myers

  teaser: Software testing is a relatively new field.  Few people agree on how to do it "right."  Some consider this book to be a classic on the subject.
