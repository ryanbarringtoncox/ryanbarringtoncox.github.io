Anybody who says they don't get intimidated is lying.  They may be lying because theyâ€™re intimidated.

I've denied intimidation.  It's always easier to decide that we don't like somebody or don't want to be around them if they make us uncomfortable.

**What if I lean into intimidation?**

**What if I make a point to spend more time around the people that intimidate me?**

Intimidation is real.  There's something there, something that needs work.

When I lose my confidence and get intimidated, that's ok.  That means I'm up against something challenging.  That means I haven't made peace or bested something within me yet.  There is room to grow.

**I'm noticing the people who intimidate me and I'm seeking them out, coming back for more.  They have a lot to teach me.**
