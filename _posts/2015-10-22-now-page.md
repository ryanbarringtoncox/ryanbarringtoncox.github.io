Derek Sivers posted about his [/now page](https://sivers.org/nowff) yesterday.  His /now page is a public declaration of his current priorities, where he's spending his time.

If Sivers wants to work on something that isn't on his /now, he asks himself -

  - Should I be working on this?
  - Should I add it to my /now page?"

His post invites others to create and share their own /now pages in the comments below.  It's interesting to scroll down and see what others are doing.

I love this idea!  I sit down once a week and write down my priorities, to keep focused.  Otherwise, I might drift off on too many new ventures and never finish anything.

Here is [my /now page]({{site.url}}/now).  I plan to keep it updated and concise. It's better to do a few things well than a bunch of things half-assedly.

What are your current priorities?

What are you working on now?
