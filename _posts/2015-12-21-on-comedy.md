What makes stand-up comedy funny?

How does comedy work?

Here are some paraphrased pro tips on the topic (from this [excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKY6BGcx37k)).

  - Chris Rock: Repeat the premise again and again. They aren't laughing because they don't know what you're talking about.
  - Louis CK: Take a subject and don't leave it alone until there's nothing left of it.  Take them to a place they have tension and make them laugh there.
  - Ricky Gervais: Write about what you know. Make the ordinary extraordinary. That's how you connect. Make them as excited as you.
  - Jerry Seinfeld: Do it for them. Give. **If you're doing it for you, they'll feel it and they won't like it.**
