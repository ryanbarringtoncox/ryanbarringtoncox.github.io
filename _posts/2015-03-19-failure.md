I've had a couple failures recently.  I failed in areas where I've had a streak of victories.  In both cases, I was blindsided by the failure, caught off guard.  My ego was bruised.

My first reaction was frustration.  I wanted to quit these pursuits and do something where I could succeed.

Now that I've had days and weeks to reflect on these failures, I'm seeing the point.

**Failure is inevitable.**

**Failure is the best way to find the edges.**

**Failure let's us know our current limitations.  This is valuable information.**

We can work around these limitations and harness this information to improve and try new strategies.

If I'm not failing, I'm probably playing it too safe.  When I'm breaking new ground, I fail more frequently.

Getting used to the taste of failure and learning to push through it is one of the greatest skills to master.
