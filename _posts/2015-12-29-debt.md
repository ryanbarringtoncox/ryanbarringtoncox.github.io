Debt is the devil.

Debt slams doors, stomps your freedom and keeps you from living the life of your dreams.

Americans are hooked on debt.  We spend more of our life's earnings on debt that anything else. This is insane!

**Rich people get richer by selling us debt. They know we'll choose to pay more over time instead of planning ahead and delaying gratification.**

There is a reason why you get so many credit card offers in the mail.  They are effective slavery contracts.

My wife and I have come up with a plan to become debt-free in the coming years ([this book]({{site.url}}/book-notes/total-money-makeover) has helped us get clear on the steps). It's not how much you make so much as what you do with it.

Getting the debt devil off your heels is worthwhile, but not easy.

**Debt is the opposite of freedom.**

Freedom is priceless.
