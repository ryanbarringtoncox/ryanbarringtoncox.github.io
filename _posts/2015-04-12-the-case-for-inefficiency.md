As a programmer, I'm trained to think in terms of efficiency. Managing efficiency is a powerful skill.  Whether you're writing code, designing an engine or managing your personal time, it's often beneficial to err on the side of efficiency.

**There are times when inefficiency is desirable.**

I wrote about [taking steps](/taking-steps) a few weeks ago.  Here is an instance where it's better to be inefficient.  Why park close to the building?  Walking is good for my health.  Exercise in general is about exerting effort to get more gains. Here is a case where inefficiency pays off.

**Don't let efficiency creep into every aspect of your life.**

When I'm learning a new programming language, I can copy and paste code from examples.  That's quicker, yes, but I retain more new information if I type it all out by hand and think through it.

**Exerting force and struggling leads to more growth.**

Spending time with loved ones is not a time for efficiency either.  Go slow.  Savor the words.  Our time together is limited.

Efficiency is golden in many cases, but let's not be too efficient.
