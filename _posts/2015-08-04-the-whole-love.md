title: The Whole Love
description: The ugly pieces will always poke out, but beauty is defined by these pieces.

*To keep one's own integrity, be merciful and uncorrupted and not wish for evil; and not be duped by dreams of universal justice or happiness.  These dreams will not be fulfilled.*\\
*To know this, and know that however ugly the parts appear the whole remains beautiful...*\\
*Organic wholeness, the wholeness of life and things, the divine beauty of the universe.*\\
*Love that, not man apart from that, or else you will share man's pitiful confusions, or drown in despair when his days darken.* - Robinson Jeffers

I try to understand the pieces of good living -  sleeping, exercising, eating well, doing meaningful work, cultivating relationships and love.

Breaking life into discrete pieces helps me manage the complexity of the Whole. It works to a point. But like all methods, dissection has its limits.

**When I view things in isolation, I lose the big picture.  I lose the Whole Love.**

What about the relationships and interactions between the pieces?

This connective tissue may be difficult to reason about, but it is certainly part of the Whole experience (perhaps most of it?).

The Whole is a beautiful bouncing organic creature beyond reason, dissection and absolute understanding.

When I'm upset over a person or a moment, I've lost my sense of the Whole.

As Jeffers point out, the "divine beauty of the universe" is in "the wholeness of life and things."

**The ugly pieces will always poke out, but beauty is defined by these pieces.**

**Accept displeasure as part of the larger context, the all-encompassing Whole and love the Whole thing.**

**Wholeheartedly.**
