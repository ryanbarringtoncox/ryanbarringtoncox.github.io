title: Out of the Box
---
I've been rewriting [my priorities]({{site.url}}/now), whittling them down to a [lean]({{site.url}}/say-less), [sustainable]({{site.url}}/sustain) core.

Question: Where does art fit in to a busy life?

Answer: Everywhere. Each interaction, post and performance is an opportunity to connect and do something new.

I've rewritten the same songs and blog posts.  I don't want to do that anymore. I want to get out of the damn box!

I want to [surprise]({{site.url}}/the-twist) myself, take more [risks]({{site.url}}/risking-embarrassment), [stop repeating myself]({{site.url}}/keeping-it-dry) and yes, write some posts that suck.

This blog is a space to experiment, fail, prevail and crank out [new ideas]({{site.url/ideas-man}}).

I'm not as concerned with perceived quality as I am with getting out of the box.
