Be able to explain.

**You'll know your idea is refined when you can articulate it to others.**

Practice is the only way.

Start by talking to yourself.

Say your piece.  Edit it.  Shave off words.  **Get to the point.**  Add humor whenever possible.

Then speak your mind to others.  Notice when their eyes start to glaze over.  Take note of where and when you lose them.

**Stop talking when you've lost them. Don't waste people's time!**

Retreat. Regroup. Practice some more. Have another go at speaking to someone.

**When you can explain yourself and hold their attention, you're close to mastering your idea.**

Be able to explain.
