*Metacognition is "cognition about cognition", or "knowing about knowing". It comes from the root word "meta", meaning beyond. It can take many forms; it includes knowledge about when and how to use particular strategies for learning or for problem solving.* - From [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition)

Metacognition is similar to [Meta Learning](/meta-learning), but not quite the same.  The latter asks the question, “How do I learn?”  Metacognition seeks to answer broader questions such as, “What are my thought processes?” or "How do I solve problems?"

**Seeking insight into our own ways of thinking is a worthwhile undertaking. Nobody else thinks quite like I (or you) do after all.**

Many of my posts here deal with Metacognition, though I've only started using the word recently. As I ponder this newfound word, these thoughts come to mind.

  - Simply asking, "[How do I think?](/how-to-think)" and "What thinking approaches have worked the best?" has yielded wonderful results.
  - My mind likes to [alternate](/alternating-current) between producing and consuming.
  - [Confusion](/confusion-confidence) can feel unpleasant at first, but pushing through it often results in breakthroughs.
  - [Meditation](/thoughts-on-meditation) helps greatly with Metacognition. Sit and be aware of the mind.  Watch it.  Understand it.
  - I absorb more info when I [hang loose](/hang-loose).

I love it when I find a new term for an [idea](/ideas-man) I've had brewing.  It tells me I'm onto something and there is more to be gleaned.

**Let's seek to understand our own minds and thought processes better. That's what Metacognition is all about.**
