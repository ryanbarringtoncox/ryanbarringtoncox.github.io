Are you ready?

Are you happy?

Did you like the movie?

Are you pro-life or pro-choice?

Questions like these prompt us to choose between only two choices, to draw a line in the sand between this and that.

The line in the sand is artificial.

Our choices aren't black and white.  They're shades of gray.

Just because someone asks you a yes-or-no question doesn't mean you have to respond in those terms.
