Singing connects me to my [heart](/heart) when I've been thinking all day.

Singing lifts my spirits and boosts my immune system.

Singing does all this whilst being fun.

As a teenager, I spent countless hours in my room [singing other people's songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkka8P2L5EE&list=PLEP0Foq1SruO4joWuSAQ_8-eQQVfQAj0W) to myself.

It felt good to sing then.

It feels good to sing now.

Singing marries the physical, the mental and the emotional.  The Spiritual too!  Every major religion on earth uses singing as ritual.

On stage.

In the car.

In the shower.

Together or alone.

**Just sing.**

In time.

Out of time.

On or off key.

Singing is a gift.

**Let's sing more.**
