Our own children are easy to love.  So innocent.  So pure (even when theyâ€™re devils).

As parents, we are wired to love our children unconditionally.

We love everything about our daughter.  Her goofy body language.  Her art.  The silly things she says.

We love our daughter without expectation or ego.

We love her with a bottomless empathy.

We forgive her for all mistakes.

**Kids are Easy Love.  All the time.**

I'm grateful to have a daughter who shows me every day what it feels like to truly love.

It's a hell of a yardstick.

Now I want to get more of my other relationships measuring up.
