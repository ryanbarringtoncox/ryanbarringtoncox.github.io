There’s a zen concept of cutting away rather than adding.  Working with what’s already there.  Making it lean and focused.

As we get more options, more information at our fingertips, the concept of cutting away appeals to me more and more.

The more I blog, the more I’m removing unnecessary words, cutting things out, paring it back.

If I have a lot to say on a topic, then I know I’m onto something.

If I want **you** to take an interest in my ideas, I need to be concise.  Your time is valuable.

So... I find a topic that excites me and dump it all out on the "page."

Then I carve the block.

I shave off unnecessary words and syllables.

I trim the fat.

**I'm trying to make a point in as few words as possible.**

When I browse the internet, I appreciate writers who get to the point and say a lot with a minimum of words.

That's the challenge.

That’s what I’m trying to do here.
