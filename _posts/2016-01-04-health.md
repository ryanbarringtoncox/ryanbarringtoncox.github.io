We've got another baby girl coming this year and I'm excited to meet her.

Our new baby will bring more love and joy our way.  She'll also bring less sleep and the temptation to be less healthy.

I'd like to be as healthy as possible this year.  **Perfection is not the goal here**, but I do want to keep these ideals in mind and do my best.

  - Sleep as much as possible.
  - Be present; meditate every day for at least five minutes.
  - Consume moderately; eat and drink well.
  - Exercise five times a week for at least twenty minutes.
  - Keep to the [simple]({{site.url}}/simplicity); clutter, debt and unnecessary projects bring stress and complication.
  - **Don't be too rigid about this list;** failure is fine.

Our children are only warm little babies for a short time.  Blink and it's over.  I want to take care of myself and my family this year so I can enjoy it.

**We're no good to anyone when we don't take care of ourselves.**
