title: Feeling

I steeped myself in music when I was a teenager.  Songs would give me chills and make the hairs on my arm literally stand up.  This was magic! I could *feel* the music long before I could dissect it mentally.

As I get older, my schedule and mind navigate increasing [clutter]({{site.url}}/clutter).  [Failures]({{site.url}}/failure) try to numb me.

It's tempting to feel things less as an adult.

I'm writing these posts, telling stories and jokes and making music to chase feelings, to keep [the magic of my youth]({{site.url}}/fireflies).

I want to stay connected to these feelings and find new ones.

I have a busy brain and it gets in the way sometimes.

Thinking is a good thing to do.

Feeling is better.
