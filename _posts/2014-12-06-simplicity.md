A useful computer program that's simple has more value than an equally useful, complex one.

It's easier to read.

To understand.

To maintain.

**A gripping novel that uses plain, simple language and short sentences.**

**Lush and  beautiful songs that have minimal chord changes.**

**A delicious meal that has only a handful of ingredients.**

Elegance is divine.

Complexity is confusing.

I scratch my head and wonder, "Do I like this?"

Simplicity is barebones.

I know if I like it or not immediately.

I know if it holds up.

I feel simplicity in my gut.  *(not my head)*

In relationships, work, love, music, programming, family.

Keep to the simple.

Strip it back.

Cut away.

Let the

ideas

shine

.
