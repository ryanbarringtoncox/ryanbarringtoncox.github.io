title: Pulling Weight

One of my biggest pet peeves is working with people who don't pull their weight.  I have been known to make snide remarks at non-weight-pullers (not proud, just confessing).

Here's something I keep re-discovering and re-forgetting:  **I can't get people to do things they don't want to do.**

Getting mad at slackers yields no fruit.  It adds a coat of agony to the situation.  It seals in the misery.

I'm better off focusing on my actions and responses.

Notes to self:

  - Stop judging
  - Get to work
  - Find flow
  - *Be* the change

Maybe they'll follow.  Maybe they won't.

Focus on what can be.  Forget the rest.

That's how I'll pull my weight.
