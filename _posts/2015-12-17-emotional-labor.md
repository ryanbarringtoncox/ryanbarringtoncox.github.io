title: Emotional Labor

"It's just a paycheck."

I hope I never say that about my job.

I want to do great work.

I want to spend my hours [enthusiastically]({{site.url}}/enthusiasm).

**Emotional labor means I care enough to lean in, push harder, get personal and make connections.**

I have worked on projects where major stakeholders are apathetic about success.  Their paycheck is the same regardless of the project's outcome.  In these scenarios, I have to make a difference or find another project quick.

**Slacking is easy.  It takes guts to care.**

Doctors, waiters and janitors.  Some put in the extra emotional labor and some don't.

We can always tell the difference.

It's right there in the work.
