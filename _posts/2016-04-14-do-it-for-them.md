title: Do it for Them
---
The signs have always pointed to one simple [mantra]({{site.url}}/mantras):

**Do it for them.**

I keep forgetting and re-remembering because my ego is too big and my brain is too busy.

Do it for them.  Do it for them. Do it for them.

Connect by providing value for someone else.

Do it for them.
