I overheard someone use an old expression the other day.  He said, "Don't reinvent the wheel."

I've never understood that expression.

Do our cars roll on wooden medieval wagon wheels?

Do our bicycles spin rock cylinders?

The reinvention of the wheel is one of the only things we've consistently done well, millions and millions of times.  It's called progress.

Why are we picking on wheels?

Nobody says, "Don't reinvent the pulley."
