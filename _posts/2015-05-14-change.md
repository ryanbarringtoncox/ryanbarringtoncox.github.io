They say you can’t change somebody.  That may true.

**You can change yourself.**

I’ve done it.  I’m doing it.  It’s natural to keep changing and evolving.

Be aware that your job and the people around you will often try to keep you from changing.  Some of these people keep you grounded and others hold you back.  Tis a careful balance, my friend.

Slow, steady progress works best for me.  That and plenty of dreaming.  Lie down and stare up at the ceiling, the clouds.  Who do you want to be?  How do you want to be?  What are the differences between those ideals and where you are now?

Write it down.

Make a list.

Prioritize that list.

Get excited.

**Visualize yourself the way you want to be.**

Work steadily on one goal until it’s habitual.  Learn to delay gratification.  Start on the next goal.  These efforts will snowball.

**Always veer towards enthusiasm.  Enthusiasm is your compass.  Enthusiasm is your fuel.**

Change is healthy.  Change is inherent and natural.  Powerful institutions and people will tell you otherwise.  They are wrong.
