I like my leaders, speakers, singers and lecturers best when they're empathetic and confident.

When I can feel their ego pressing on me, that's a turn-off.  Ego makes me less likely to follow.

The line between ego and confidence gets thin sometimes.

Ego makes it about you and pushes us away.

Confidence draws us in and leads us.

Confidence and ego are often at odds with one another.

When in doubt, err on the side of confidence.

Let go of the ego.
