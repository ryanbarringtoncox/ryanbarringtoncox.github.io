My [/now page]({{site.url}}/now) reminds me what I'm doing now.

This bucket holds the things I will do later, when my schedule allows.

  - Publish a book
  - Do more acts of public service
  - Put out more [albums](/future-albums) of <a target="_blank" href="https://ryanbarringtoncox.bandcamp.com/">my music</a>
  - [Tai Chi]({{site.url}}/relax): Push hands regularly, learn the sword form
  - **Start a podcast, interview people who inspire me**
  - Perform longer sets of [comedy]({{site.url}}/on-comedy), keep the laughs rolling
