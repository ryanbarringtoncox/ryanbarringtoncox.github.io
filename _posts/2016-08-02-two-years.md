title: Two Years
---
This blog just turned two years old. This is my 250th post.

It's been great writing regularly on self-improvement, health, workflow optimization, and experimenting with fables, poems, jokes and more. 

This blog doesn't have a cohesive theme like the blogs I read.  Perhaps I'll get there one day.  For now, it mirrors my curiosities and obsessions, my life's work with family, health and art.

Thanks very much for reading these posts.  I always love to hear readers' thoughts, positive or negative, so don't be shy and [email me](mailto:ryanbarrington@gmail.com).

Here's to the next two years!
