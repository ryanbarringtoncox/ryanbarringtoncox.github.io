I like to think of myself as an Ideas Man.

I search through other people’s ideas, ingest the ones that appeal to me and try them out.  I'm most interested in useful, applicable ideas.

After an idea sticks, it morphs into my own version of the original idea.  It changes over time, just like nature.  Everything is in flux.

Some ideas don’t stick.  I try them for a while and discard them.  There is value in these ideas too.  The knowledge gained from trying something new is not to be underestimated.  I never know when some seemingly random idea from the past will prove useful today.

Ideas are infinite.  I am constantly pleased and surprised by this.  The more ideas I come up with, the more ideas I come up with.

**Ideas have gravity.**

**Ideas attract ideas.**

This blog is an exercise in cultivating the gravity of ideas.
