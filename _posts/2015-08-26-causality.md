This blog has caused so many great changes in my life.  It's changed my thinking, steered my career and improvement my relationships.

Wait, maybe the positive changes in my life caused this blog...

Or maybe the changes and this blog are causing one another?

Perhaps a third factor, like becoming a parent, caused me to start blogging and have more positive developments in my life?!

My point is it's difficult to be objective about causality and, in the end, we can never be certain we got it right.

When it comes to this blog and positive life changes, I'm just happy to be here and don't necessarily care "how" it happened.

When I'm troubleshooting a technical problem, I have to theorize accurately about causes and effects.  In these cases, it's best to keep an open, analytical mind and consider all possible paths.

Don't just assume that A causes B.  B may have be causing A too.  And C might be causing A and B.

Often times, it's a little of everything.
