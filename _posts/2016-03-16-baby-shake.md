Child birth is amazing.

Labor is insane.

If you haven't witnessed labor firsthand, they made a movie about it called *Aliens*.

Before you can take your baby home from the hospital they make you watch a movie called *Don't Shake the Baby*.

You're sitting there holding your precious newborn baby, watching this horror flick, going, "Who would do such an awful thing?  Who would *shake* a baby?!"

Sixteen consecutive sleepless nights later...

Your fridge is full of salad dressing and it's all well-shaken.
