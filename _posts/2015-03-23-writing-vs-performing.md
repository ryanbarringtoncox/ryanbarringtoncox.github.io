I fell in love with writing at an early age.  I discovered I could write every day and keep discovering new things.

Writing was easy because I didn't have to coordinate with anybody else.  Writing was solo bliss.  And writing words morphed into writing melodies and songs.

Performing was different.  It was hard to find places to perform music growing up.  I could write and practice every day but only perform a few times each year.

Part of this was shyness.  I never joined plays or debates or went on tour with a Comedy Troupe. I didn't feel comfortable playing contemporary Christian music at church.

Somewhere along the way, my writing chops exceeded my performance chops.  The gap widened over the years.

Only recently have I realized that sharing my message may be just as important as writing it.  Hence this blog, public speaking, the youtube videos, etc.

It's one thing to say it in your room.  It's another to put it out there into the world for other's to judge.

The latter can be scary, but performing actually makes us better writers.  It's good to get feedback and see what's working (and what isn't).  We get better at performing when we do it more.

**Perhaps best of all, performing makes us brave.**

I'll always cherish my love of writing.  I'm excited to explore performance more too.  **Performance brings writing out of the shadows and into the world.**
