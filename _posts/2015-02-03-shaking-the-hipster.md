I tried to be cool for twenty years and I think that I actually got close to being cool for a few minutes there (though I'd be the last to know).  **Now that I'm moving further away from coolness every day, I couldn't be more content.**

When I became a parent, I spent that first year trying to still be “out there” and cool whilst becoming a good parent.  I was nearly split in two trying to juggle those opposing goals.  I finally gave in and resigned to being the best father and husband I could be (and *can* be, still working on that).

As a result, I’ve never been more fulfilled.  There are days and moments of agony, yes, but on a macro level, my life has more meaning, focus and love than ever before.

**The energy I put into love pays back ten fold against showing up for hipster culture.**

I'm not out there playing shows at night.  I'm getting down on the floor with my daughter and playing, getting silly.  I sing children’s songs.  I even cry during animated movies sometimes.  Nothing cool about that!

Once I finally stopped trying to be hip, all these doors opened up.  I can breathe, be vulnerable and throw up this post without fear of judgement.  What a relief!

For a while there, I fell into the trap of standing back and criticizing other people who put themselves out there. That sucked.

I may never know if the whole hipster thing is a miserable sham or it just wasn’t for me.  Looking back, I was trying to be cool and never quite getting there.

**Now I realize that seeking the approval of any group is a dead-end drain, especially if that group makes me feel unwelcome or unloved.**

The best part of giving up coolness is I’m getting back to the person I was when I was a kid.  Raw, unfiltered, real me.  The payoff is the opportunity to get back into childhood enthusiasm full throttle.  **Laughter, tantrums and love are the pulp of life.**
