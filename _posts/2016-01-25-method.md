Before you do the same mind-numbing task all over again, stop.

Is there a method that will make the task quicker, easier in the end?

By investing more time up front, can you evolve and learn a new skill?

Taking the time to learn a new language, software app or way of folding clothes can buy you new levels of [flow]({{site.url}}/flow-breaker) and productivity. It will make you smarter too.

We have the tendency to [resist]({{site.url}}/the-path-of-most-resistance) learning new things because it's uncomfortable and takes a little more time now.  When we resist [challenging]({{site.url}}/people-who-challenge-us) [changes]({{site.url}}/change), we set ourselves up for a lifetime of doing the same shit over and over, the same shitty way. 

Don't do repetitive mindless work.

Invest in the right tools.

Find the elegant path.

Learn the method.
