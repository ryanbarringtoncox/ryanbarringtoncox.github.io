I have spent decades of energy and time writing songs, recording them and playing them for people.  I’ve been striving to be great, to write amazing songs that make people feel the way I felt when I was a teenager with headphones on.  Riding the bus home, lost in bliss.  Until a few years ago, my other pursuits came second to making music.

Booking shows is not easy.  Getting up in front of a bar room crowd and trying to hold their attention, make them feel, make them care for forty minutes?  Not easy either.  The mission was challenging, thrilling even.  There was no instruction manual.  We wrote it ourselves, and we had some successes and some failures.

About five years ago, I turned 30 and started trying some different things.  I tried computer programming and got a response right away.  I’ve had three jobs in the past five years, each better than the last (ok, ok, maybe the first one wasn’t a real “job” but it was a start).  More recently, I’ve started doing some speaking projects and gotten a good response from that too.

It’s nice to get a response, to be heard, which brings me to this idea of remarkability.  The idea has been brewing in me for a few years now, but Seth Godin gave me the right word for it (Thanks, Seth!).  We are bombarded with media, with information.  We carry rectangles in our pockets that have the whole history of recorded music on them.  How badly does the world need a new song?  When we hear a new band that’s really good or even great, how big of a deal is that?

This is not the 50s.  Rock n Roll isn’t exploding onto the scene, mixing up the rules, redefining our culture.  Rock is not that risky right now.

What fills that void?

“Remarkable” literally means “worth remarking about.”  What can we do that’s worth remarking about?  This usually aligns with risk, change, confronting fear, stepping outside of the things we do “well.”

I’ve noticed that trying different things, new things, riskier things, is getting me more of a response than trying to put my songs out into the world.

At a certain point, it felt like I was trying so hard to get people to notice my music.  It got to be kind of draining.  Writing songs and recording them, playing them for a close friend, is one of the easiest most beautiful things in the world.  As long as the songs are coming, I will be grateful to write them.

However, I’m not sure I need a response to my music right now. From the world, I mean.

This blog is another risk, a challenge, an attempt to mix things up, try something new, get out of my routine.  Let’s see what happens.
