Sleep, Nutrition and Exercise.

Not necessarily in that order.

They seem to be a solid baseline for being content and productive.

All three are basic concepts, but it’s easy to lose sight of them.  When one of the three slides, the others tend to go with it.  I won’t get enough sleep, for example.  Then I eat junk food to alleviate my bad feelings and get a burst of pleasure.  Then I feel greasy and drained so I don’t exercise.

The downward spiral ensues.

The opposite holds as well.  When I’m sleeping eight hours a night, eating reasonably well and exercising three times a week, I feel more energized and positive.  As I gather momentum and appreciate feeling good, I’m more likely to keep on it.

Sometimes it’s tempting to pull an all-nighter and work late, but this can wreck several of the following days  and do more harm than good (kids wake up early!).

**When things are not going well, I’m coming back to these three things:  Sleep, Nutrition and Exercise.  Keeping them in order creates a positive domino effect.**

*Disclaimer: I write this as a lover of beer and chicken wings!  All things in moderation.  I am, however, noticing that I enjoy these indulgences more when I’m setting a healthy baseline.*
