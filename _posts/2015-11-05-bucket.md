I created my [/now page]({{site.url}}/now) to keep [focused]({{site.url}}/focus).

There are limited hours in the day/week/year and it takes a certain level of commitment to get a worthy [return on investment]({{site.url}}/return-on-investment) from a venture.

**When I try to do everything, nothing gets done.**

With that in mind, this bucket holds the things I will do before I die, but not right now.

You might even call it a bucket list.

  - Do a quick, no-nonsense "album" of my favorite unrecorded songs
  - Make an electro-pop album that sounds nothing like my other albums
  - Interview [Modulogeek](http://modulogeek.com/)
  - Tell a story on [The Moth](http://themoth.org/)
  - Deliver a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks)
  - [Tai Chi]({{site.url}}/relax): Push hands again regularly and learn the sword form
  - Publish a book
  - Do further research on the following subjects
    - comedy
    - chaos/complexity
    - history of computing
    - data analysis/visualization
    - biology/health
    - economics/investing
    - survivalism
    - meditation/relaxation
