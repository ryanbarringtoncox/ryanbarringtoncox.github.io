title: Future Albums
---
I used to record an <a target="_blank" href="https://ryanbarringtoncox.bandcamp.com/">album</a> of [my music]({{site.url}}/music) every year.  Nowadays, I don't have enough time to keep that up. I am still writing songs though.

I make albums for me.  Albums are an opportunity to capture a time period and learn more about what's going on inside me.  And [singing]({{site.url}}/sing) feels good.

I want each album to be unique, to stand apart from my previous efforts.  Let this post serve as a reminder (to me) of my future album ideas. Here are the future albums I want to make.  

  - A mostly-live psych rock album with songs in "exotic" modes.
  - An electro-pop album - built with beats, loops and synths - that sounds nothing like my other albums.
  - A collection of songs that are arranged with only vocals and percussion.  No guitars, bass, keys, etc.
  - An album where I sing songs on acoustic guitar with a drummer, keep the live vocal take with bleed and pepper in a few other instruments as needed.
  - A no-nonsense iPhone-recorded collection of my favorite songs and comedy bits.  This should be quick and easy to do since everything is captured live and requires no overdubbing or mixing.

Each album should sound great to my ears, but [perfection]({{site.url}}/perfection) is not the goal.  Capturing something honest and pure is.

I miss making albums and look forward to making more in the future.
