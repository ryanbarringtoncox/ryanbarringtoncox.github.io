I just posted my [50th YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGDj9g5K_z0).

As a teenager, I loved watching videos of my favorite performers.  I'd watch them over and over on VHS.  I wanted to do that.

When I got my first laptop years ago, I tried recording myself a few times.  My early attempts made me cringe. I couldn't bear to watch.  I hated the way I looked and sounded!

**I now realize that most of us squirm when we see ourselves on film.**

**Why run from it?**

I love recording these videos because:

  - It takes less than ten minutes to film a video with my laptop and throw it onto the internet.
  - They capture real raw moments in time.  No reverb, overdubs or trickery.
  - They stretch the limits of my comfort zone.  I'm [risking embarrassment](/risking-embarrassment) every time I throw one up.
  - Anybody in the world with an internet connection to  YouTube can watch them for free.

These videos have inspired me to take more risks and put myself out there in new ways, especially when it makes me uncomfortable.
