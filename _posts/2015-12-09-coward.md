We're all cowards sometimes.

I used to think brave people were born brave, cowards born cowards.  Movies and books play into this paradigm.

**We are all brave sometimes and cowardly other times.**

Bravery and cowardice define one another.

Instead of asking, "Am I a coward?" let's ask, "*When* am I a coward?  Under what circumstances?"

Often times, cowardice comes from doing nothing, from inaction.

Let's be aware of the circumstances where we cower.

Let's seek [slow steady growth]({{site.url}}/slow-steady-growth). Life may be a journey from cowardice to bravery (how many stories are about this journey?).

It's okay to be a coward so long as we're brave.

Cowardice happens by default.

**Seek the brave.**
