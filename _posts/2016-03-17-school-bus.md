Life is short.

You can lengthen your life by sitting in church and driving behind school buses.

School buses are interesting.  The school bus stops at every railroad crossing, but it has no seat belts.  What is the logic here?

"Buckle up!  It's the law.  Unless... it's a steel yellow box packed with children sailing down a concrete hill, piloted by a medicated high school dropout."

"In this case, screw seat belts!  The real threat is *RUNAWAY TRAINS*!"
