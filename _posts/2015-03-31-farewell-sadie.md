Today I'm saying goodbye to my loyal companion of the past 13 years.  Sadie was the most beautiful dog I've ever seen.  That's why I picked her, despite her tendency to bark loudly and jump on people.

Sadie was mostly German Shepherd.  We know that much.  Everybody who met her had their own ideas about other breeds inside her. 

Sadie was very large and protective.  Even as a cat-sized puppy, she could make thunderous sounds.  She had to personally inspect every person that entered our house, by sniffing them and looking them in the eye.

Despite her intimidating nature, Sadie never bit anybody (thought she startled many!).  I always felt safe with Sadie by my side, whether we were in the city, the countryside or the woods.

Sadie was long-legged and athletic.  She loved to run and jump through the Appalachian mountains. In her younger days, we'd go on trail runs and hike for hours.  She always seemed calm and peaceful in the woods.

These past few years, Sadie's back legs and hips started giving out due to hip dysplasia.  She kept fairly active until these past few months, when she could barely go on walks.  It was hard to watch her lose her mobility. The pain killers and anti-inflammatory pills helped ease her suffering for a little while.

Sadie was not only my friend and companion, but a teacher too.  She taught me about loyalty and heart.  She taught me about nonverbal communication and the pleasures of shared comfortable silence.  Sadie would've taken a bullet for anyone in our family without a moment's hesitation.  That's love.  She always reminded me that food is good and should be enjoyed too.

Thank you, Sadie, for all the laughter, love, fun and now a healthy dose of tears.

Please rest in peace, sweet girl.
