I created my [now page]({{site.url}}/now) to keep [focused]({{site.url}}/focus).  If I chase every idea that pops into my head, nothing gets done.

[Less is more]({{site.url}}/say-less).

It takes a certain level of commitment to get a worthy [Return on Investment]({{site.url}}/return-on-investment) from a venture.

**I am inspired to pursue things that require more time than I have right now.**

With that in mind, this bucket holds the things I want to do before I die.  You might even call it a "Bucket List."
