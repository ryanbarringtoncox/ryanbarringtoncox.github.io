title: Sustain

We all know what it's like to burn out, but how do we sustain?

It takes years, decades even, to master a craft.  That new fuzzy feeling wears off quickly.  It's no wonder most people quit before they achieve mastery.

I've been blogging and speaking publicly for almost two years now.  These crafts are essentially two sides of the same coin - writing and performing words, trying to connect - and I love them both.

I plan to fold writing and performing further into my life.  To truly master these crafts, I need to set a sustainable pace.  This means -

  - Having fewer ambitions, focusing on [the few things that matter most]({{site.url}}/now)
  - Setting clear, measurable [goals]({{site.url}}/have-a-plan) when possible (i.e. 3-month, 1-year, 10-year)
  - [Renewing]({{site.url}}/renewal) often
  - [Enjoying]({{site.url}}/enjoy) the journey

**Setting a sustainable pace is a key aspect of mastery.**
