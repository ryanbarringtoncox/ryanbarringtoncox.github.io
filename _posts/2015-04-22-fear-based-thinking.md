I grew up with fear-based thinking.

It's taken me several decades to realize that hopeful intentions work better for me.  I enjoy my days and achieve more when I **choose** to be optimistic about risks, change and the unknowns ahead.

**I can steer my fate by changing my attitude.**

There is still a voice within me that nags me, especially on my weaker days.  "Don't take the risk.  Stay safe.  Keep your head low.  You might lose what you've got!" it says.

This voice is always with me and it breeds fear which can turn to paralysis.  I've made [habits](/tracking-good-habits) to keep this voice from conquering me (this blog is one of them) and learned a few things in the process.

  - Movement is life.
  - Evolution is growth.
  - My time here is short, fluid and ever-changing.
  - I have to keep growing and adapting or else I'm sliding in the opposite direction.

When I write about [risk](/risking-embarrassment) and [stability](/stability), I'm not advocating recklessness.  I'm not saying that we should throw opportunities away, leave a job without lining up the next one or take what we have for granted.

I'm talking about keeping fear-based thinking at bay.

We are all products of the environments that we grew up in.  As adults, it's up to us to decide which ideologies to embrace and which ones to cast to the wind.

One of my life missions is to get over fear-based thinking and hit the ground running.
