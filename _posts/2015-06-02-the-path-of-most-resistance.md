Sometimes the path of least resistance is the path of most resistance.

When I think of the path of least resistance, I usually mean getting something or somewhere as easily, as quickly as possible.

Often times the quickest and easiest way to reach a longterm goal is to endure stress, [challenges](/people-who-challenge-us) and [threats](/threat).  **Resistance can accelerate our learning if it doesn’t crush us.**

Don’t get crushed.

Know the limits.

Keep at the edges of those limits.

**Expand those limits.**

Sometimes the path of least resistance is the path of most resistance.
