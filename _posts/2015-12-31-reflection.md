It's New Year's and Leo's [Year-End Reflection post](http://zenhabits.net/yearend/) reminds me to [look back]({{site.url}}/look-back) and appreciate the past year.

In 2015, I'm glad I -

  - Made [love]({{site.url}}/ten-posts-on-love) a priority.
  - Wrote 152 [blog posts]({{site.url}}/posts).
  - Interviewed for three new jobs and updated my resume.
  - Took a new position as [software tester]({{site.url}}/testing) and immersed myself in the discipline (yes, it pays more).
  - Got settled in our new house.  My lovely wife and I hand-built a picket fence and privacy panels for our porch. We also planted a maple tree and coordinated gutter, chimney and roof replacement.
  - Became president of my [Toastmasters club](http://www.ashevilletoastmasters.com/), wrote and delivered a dozen speeches and won 2nd place in the NC Division A Humorous Speech Contest.
  - Recorded and released [42 new music videos  on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEP0Foq1SruN9ZA-dz9VbSYaLCF1gWnVP)
  - Got my wife pregnant.
  - Attended [stand-up open mics]({{site.url}}/comedy) and started writing jokes.
  - Read inspiring books and started a [book notes section]({{site.url}}/book-notes) on this site to keep track of what I learn (inspired by [Sivers](https://sivers.org)).
  - Added a [/now page]({{site.url}}/now) to this site (also inspired by Sivers).  **Publicly declaring my priorities and keeping them up to date has given me a giant productivity boost.**
  - Started exercising 5 times a week and sleeping more by [tracking these numbers daily]({{site.url}}/tracking-good-habits).
  - Wrote [new songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMBpkp9UeKY).
  - Released [this EP](https://ifyouwannas.bandcamp.com/album/higher-than-low) and performed live with my band, The If You Wannas.
  - Came up with a plan to become [debt-free]({{site.url}}/debt).
  - Built [this website](http://www.thehopicecreamcafe.com).

Five years ago, I was stuck in a crappy job, broke, living unhealthily and getting very little done.  Then I started reading [inspiring bloggers](http://sebastianmarshall.com/how-do-i-write-so-much-you-ask-well-glad-you-asked) and felt the spark to actively [change my life]({{site.url}}/change).

This blog helps tremendously with my productivity.  It's amazing how much I can accomplish when I [write regularly]({{site.url}}/writing-is-projecting) about [what excites me]({{site.url}}/enthusiasm).

In 2016, I want to lean further towards language and human connection. **I want to share more love and humor with the people around me.**  I also want to eat better, spend less money and drink less alcohol.  You can expect to see more posts on these topics in 2016.

Until then, [thanks so much]({{site.url}}/gratitude) for reading and happy new year!
