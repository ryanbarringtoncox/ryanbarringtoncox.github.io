I don’t want to be the person who complains about being at work.

“Ugh, is it only Tuesday?”

We all have “off days,” but life is far too short to keep showing up every day for a job the doesn’t inspire.

I hope I never say, "It's just a paycheck."

I want to be feel [enthusiasm](/enthusiasm) for my work.

Love to work.

Work at loving.

Success follows.
