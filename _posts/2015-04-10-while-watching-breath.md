This is another post on meditation, which has changed my life for the better.  You can read some intro meditation posts [here](/thoughts-on-meditation), [here](/sitting-still) and [here](/watch-the-breath).

While you're sitting there watching your breath,

  1. Sit cross-legged on the floor or in a chair with your hands on your lap. I prefer the latter as it's easier on my knees.
  2. Sit up straight. Be alert and dignified without being rigid. Sit with dignity.
  3. Close your eyes.
  4. Listen to any sounds that you hear. Feel the temperature. Bring awareness to any smells, sounds, sensations.
  5. Feel the weight of your body. How are you feeling today? Any discomfort anywhere?
  6. Do a body scan from head to toe. Feel yourself all over.
  7. Watch the breath. Notice when you get distracted and start thinking about things. This is normal. Bring the attention gently back to the breath each time you get distracted. It may help to count the breaths.  Count one for inhale, two for exhale and so on, up to ten.  Then start over.

If you're just starting out, set a timer for five minutes.  Five minutes might feel like a long time but stick it out.  Try to gradually increase the time by one minute each time you meditate.

Meditation is a wonderful gift to give yourself, especially if you spend a lot of time up in your head.  Who doesn't want more mental quiet and clarity?
