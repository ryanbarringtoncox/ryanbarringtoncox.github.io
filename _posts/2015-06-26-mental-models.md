A mental model is a representation of a process that I hold in my head.

Mental models allow me to infer and reason about things like songs, computer programs and the universe.

**Mental models are powerful tools.**

I'm currently learning about Software Testing.  One of my first orders of business is to build up some mental models, store them in my head and play them back.

When I read passively, I forget most of what I've read.  When I stop and actively build mental models, I retain more of the information.  I visualize the concepts and ask these questions.

  - Where are the focused spots in my mental models, the areas that excite me?
  - Where are the weak spots?
  - Can I visualize time-based scenarios, get active systems moving in my mind?
  - Can I hit pause, play it in reverse?

When I'm building mental models, I don't concern myself with every nook and cranny. I'm seeking the big picture, the main components and the relationships between them.  I can always reference a book or the web for the details.  

When I retain the big picture in my head, it reduces learning friction.  I don't have to stop and reference diagrams as often. This helps me [find flow](/flow-breaker).

I carry these models around with me.

**I can do mental modeling while lying in bed.**

Each mental model that I build is my unique vision, my personal understanding of a system.

**My heroes are people with their own understanding of the world. They have unique vision.  I want to be like them.  Mental modeling helps with this.**
