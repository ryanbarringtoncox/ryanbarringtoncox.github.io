title: Family Man
---
I'm blessed to have a lovely wife, a daughter and another girl on the way.

I want to be present with these ladies and enjoy my time with them.

I want to be a family man.

The family man stays positive, listens and takes hits for the team.

The family man doesn't bitch or moan during tough times.  There will be plenty of tough times with a new baby in 2016.

I don't always measure up to these standards.  I have been known to bitch *and* moan.

[Failure]({{site.url}}/failure) is okay.

[Writing is projecting]({{site.url}}/writing-is-projecting) and I aim to be a family man.
