Bugs are defects that cause undesirable behavior in software.

**Bugs cluster.**

The longer a bug goes unfixed, the more likely it is to breed more bugs.

**Fix bugs early.**

Put off fixing bugs and you'll have more bugs to fix.

Wait too long and the system descends into chaos.

What are your undesirable behaviors? 

Where are the bugs in your personal life?

Keep your eyes peeled for bugs and fix them while you still can.
