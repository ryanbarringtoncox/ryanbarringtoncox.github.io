**When I'm feeling confused, I'm onto something.**

When I lean into confusion, I push myself.  I test the limits of my understanding.

Can I solve the puzzle at hand?

Can I make sense of what's confusing me?

My first attempts at cracking confusing problems are seldom successful.  The trick is to be relentless and keep approaching confusion from different angles.

Test it.

Try it.

Feel it out.

**Confusion is a knot best loosened by confidence, patience and unwavering resolve.**

Often times, the biggest challenge is noticing that I'm confused in the first place.  Confusion can overwhelm logic and fog my mind so I don't even know that it's here.

Let's recognize confusion early and often.

Let's greet confusion with a warm smile.

Confusion is an old friend telling me new things.

Do I have the confidence to lean into confusion and listen to what she's saying?
