title: Trial by Crowd
---
Crowds of strangers can be intimidating.  Walking up to new people and socializing isn't easy for me.  I have always avoided it and yet, I bet there's a lot to be gained from approaching new people often.

**That's why I'm starting this thirty-day Trail By Crowd Experiment.**

Each day, I'll approach a crowd of strangers (or at least one intimidating person) and strike up a conversation.  I expect awesome breakthroughs and awkward failures.

Some initial thoughts on approaching strangers.

  - Be confident, act like they already like you.
  - Be generous, bring value to the connection.
  - Go with the flow, listen, let them do most of the talking.

I want to get better at approaching crowds of new people.

Here we go!
