I’ve discovered that I can steer my life and manifest big changes just by asking questions.  Go ahead and laugh it up.  I’m serious.

There is a lot of information at our fingertips right now, which is awesome.  On the flip side, there are so many things competing for our attention that we’re often stunned, overloaded and overwhelmed.  It’s easy to find yourself midway through the day and think, “What was I doing?” (Or even worse, you don’t even know that you don’t know!)

So how do we parse all the information that’s coming at us and filter out the noise?  How do we leverage information in our favor and get what we want?

**Well, it helps if you know what you want.**

I’ve been destiny hacking by asking myself meaningful questions on a regular basis.  Stop, zoom out and remind yourself of the big picture.  Check in with your soul.  Sit down and ask yourself what you want.  Pay attention to yourself.  You deserve it.

Here are some questions I’ve been asking myself.

*What do I want out of life that I don’t have now?
*What would my dream life look like?  Use as many details as possible.
*How is my health?  What can I do to improve my health?
*Who are the most important people in my life right?  How are my relationships with them?  What can I do to improve these relationships?
*Am I making enough art?  Is there something artistic that I want to be doing that I’m not doing?  Where in my week can I carve out a more time to make art?  What do I want to say with art?
*What am I doing these days that I’d rather not be doing?

Do this a few times and you’ll start to see patterns.  Some answers fade away.  Others stick around each time, getting detailed and deeper with each round.  Some answers will give you a tingle of excitement while you’re writing them.  Pay attention to that feeling!  That’s the best part.

This is about cultivating excitement and purpose in your life.  As an added bonus, it gets us in the habit of questioning things.

There are many paths.  This either interests you or it doesn’t.  For those interested, take a little time to ask yourself these questions.  The example questions are meant to get you started.  You are encouraged to write your own questions.  The important part is doing it regularly (at least once a week) and cultivating excitement.  Circle the answers that give you that tingle.

I like to ask questions early in the morning, before the day spins up and gets noisy.

*“Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.   Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.” - Steve Jobs*
