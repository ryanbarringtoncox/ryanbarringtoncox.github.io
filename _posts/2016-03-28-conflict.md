When I'm going for it, conflict happens.

Conflict is part of working together, sharing ideas, collaborating.

Some thoughts on conflict:

  - Don't disregard it.  Lean in, seek to understand.
  - Let the other person do most of the talking.
  - Repeat what they say back to them.

Conflict can be steered towards a breakthrough.
