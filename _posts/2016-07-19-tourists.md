I was walking through downtown Asheville, savoring the [present]({{site.url}}/present) moment, when I came upon a herd of tourists.

They were fanned across the sidewalk in a thick cluster, dawdling between shop windows.  I tried and failed to pass several times.  They did not notice me.

As my heart rate increased, I called out to them. "Excuse me. Can you quit appreciating the beauty of this city?  I'm trying to take it for granted here."

They did not respond, so I cleared my throat and shouted, "Quit savoring your precious time on earth and get the hell out of the way!"
