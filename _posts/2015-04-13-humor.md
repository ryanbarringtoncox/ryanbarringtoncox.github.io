I agree with Maya.  People remember how we make them feel.

**What feels better than laughing?**

Ok, maybe sex feels better, but you can't go around doing that with everybody.  Or I can't anyway.

My point is that humor is one of the great skills to master.  Can you make people laugh?  Can you work humor into your writing and speaking?

If you can make your point, do it from the heart and make them laugh, then it's going to be alright.  You'll have plenty of opportunities to communicate. People will want to hear more.

As I delve deeper into writing and speaking, I see humor throughout the great works (particularly speaking). As I look at my own writing and speaking, I see room for more humor.

What makes humor work?  What is it?  Can we dissect it, pull it apart, mull it over?

I'm fascinated with humor, with how it works.  Expect more blog posts on this topic to come.

In the mean time, let's go make somebody laugh today.
