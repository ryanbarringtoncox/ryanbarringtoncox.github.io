Try to do everything and nothing gets done.

With that in mind, this bucket holds the things I will do before I die, but not right now.

  - Start a podcast and interview people who inspire me
  - Put out a unique <a target="_blank" href="https://ryanbarringtoncox.bandcamp.com/">album</a> every 2-3 years (more details [here](/future-albums))
  - [Tai Chi]({{site.url}}/relax): Push hands again regularly and learn the sword form
  - Do more acts of public service (i.e. teach programming or music to kids, volunteer, listen, etc)
  - Do further [research]({{site.url}}/book-notes) on health, history, meditation, comedy, mathematics, chaos, data visualization, survivalism, economics and investing
  - Tell a story on [The Moth](http://themoth.org/) and/or deliver a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks)
  - Publish a book
