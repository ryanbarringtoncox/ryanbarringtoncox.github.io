DRY is a popular acronym in the programming world.  It stands for "Don’t Repeat Yourself."

When I’m writing code, I should never write the same logic twice.  Over time, I'll inveitably have to change my code.  If I have to update the same logic in multiple places, it gets messy and error-prone.

Tis better to keep DRY.

Where else can I apply the DRY principle?

We all know the person who tells the same stories and jokes over and over.  Do you want to be that person? 

**DRY can be improvising new jokes, telling new stories, seeking out new relationships or refusing to fall back on the old repertoire.**

Bob Dylan keeps shattering his image, changing his voice and his approach every few years.

John Lennon left the Beatles to stand naked next to Yoko.

Steve Jobs kept Apple constantly evolving, releasing new products year after year.

I'm proud to say 2014 was my DRYest year to date.  I started speaking publicly, throwing up [video content](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPAbDop3NGflTwbN-tDPyBA) and blogging.  These are all new mediums, places I haven't explored before.  These unexplored places are vibrant and alive with feeling for me.

**DRY may mean casting the old script to the wind and becoming more present, more alive.**
