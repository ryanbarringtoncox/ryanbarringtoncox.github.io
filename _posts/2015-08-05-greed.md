description: We often want too much.

I have seen greed bring out the worst in people.

I have seen greed bring out the worst in myself.

We often want too much money, status or power.

Desire drives us to achieve.  Desire can work wonders in moderation.

Desire can also be contagious and insatiable.  The more we get, the more we may want.  Desire can twist our spirit into something warped, ugly and distant from love.

**The paradox of greed:  When we grapple blindly for more, love recedes from us.**

Success can spoil and turn to greed.  Greed can erode the love in our lives.

Yes, let's achieve, gain and grow.

Yes, let's keep a careful eye on greed.
