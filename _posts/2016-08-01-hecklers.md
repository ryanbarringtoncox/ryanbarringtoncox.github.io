Fifteen to twenty bikers showed up at the comedy open mic last week.  They were shouting at the performers.  It was interesting to get up and give it a go under such chaotic circumstances.  At times like these, you can't just do your jokes and pretend insanity isn't happening.  You have to acknowledge the room.

I enjoyed my five minutes on stage.  Those guys kept me on my toes. **I didn't sense any hostility from them.**  They were there to have a good time and participate, even if it was a bit obnoxious.

I'm throwing this recording up to document the experience.  I've been trying to move away from memorization and break down "the fourth wall" more.  Hecklers give you the opportunity to do just that - drop the script and pivot!

I'm grateful for this opportunity and enjoyed performing for these guys.  I think I won them over by the end.

Next time, I'll try to curse less and still keep control of the room.
