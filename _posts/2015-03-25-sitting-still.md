Sitting still.  There's just something about it.

I've always found it hard to sit still.  I'll bet that holds true for anyone who tries to sit for any length of time.

Something magical happens when I do sit still for ten, fifteen, twenty minutes.  My mind settles.  My water becomes clearer. I start being rather than acting.  This is a rare and treasured state.

Before I get up and start moving around, I ask myself to keep this state as long as possible.  To keep calm and still. To watch the breathe. Even in motion.

On a focused day, I do retain some sense of stillness after I get up.  Other days, it drifts away quickly.

There's something unique about sitting still.  I'd wager that we do this less and less as the world gets busier.

This is a reminder to myself to make some time.

For sitting still.

For non-doing.

Every day.
