I'm **Ryan Barrington Cox** and I share things that I make here.

This site currently hosts [my blog](/posts) and some of my [music videos](music).

You may have wound up here because you tried to find my old music site, **ryanbarringtoncox.com**. That site doesn't exist right now.

I've spent a lot of time writing privately.  This blog is an experiment with [becoming healthier](/sleep-nutrition-exercise/), [not repeating myself](/keeping-it-dry/), [confronting fear](/public-speaking-and-living-with-fear/), [changing](/shifting-intent/) and [finding flow](/flow-breaker/) (to name a few topics).
