##The big picture.

What do I want my life to look like in ten years?  Five years?  One year?  How do I move in that direction?

Some of us are planners and strategists, always thinking ahead.

##The close up.

How do I feel in this moment? Interacting with this person? Eating this food?

Some of us are continually swept away in the moment.  Bliss, sorrow, hunger, love.

##The balance.

How well do I toggle between the big picture and the small?

I believe in reflecting and planning often.  We steer our destiny with resolve and intent.

I also believe that the richest, most rewarding experiences are happening right now.  Only in this moment.

There’s a balance at play.

Zooming out regularly.  Getting the high level view.  Checking in with my health, marriage and career.

Zooming back in to this moment, wading into the slipstream of now.

**Shifting smoothly from macro to micro is an art I yearn to learn.**
