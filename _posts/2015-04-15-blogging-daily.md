Four weeks ago I realized that I wasn't blogging very often.  I'd fallen out of the habit and started over-thinking my posts.

The best way to overcome writer's block is to write every day.  Quit listening to the inner critic, make a commitment to yourself and start cranking it out.  I've said it before and I'll say it again:  **Quantity produces quality.** (There's a [mantra](/mantras) for you).

While I can't be objective about my own writing, I do feel that I have created more quality pieces writing daily for four weeks than I would have by writing weekly, even if I spent the whole week reflecting and editing the weekly piece.

In the first case, I wrote twenty eight posts.  In the latter, I would have written only four.

There is a common fear that we only have so much to say and we shouldn't use up all our ideas.  I completely disagree with this view. In fact, that's precisely the kind of thinking that keeps us quiet, timid and limited.

**The amount that we have to say isn't finite.  It's just the opposite, and the more we write, the more we develop that creative muscle.  The more we notice things, the more we respond, react and filter experiences through our perceptions. Writing leads to more writing.  It's a beautiful thing.**

I don't know if I'll keep writing daily or not.  I do know that it's a been a lovely exploration and something to keep in mind if I find myself with writer's block again.

I hope you've enjoyed these daily posts. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the experiment so please [email me](mailto:ryanbarrington@gmail.com) and let me know your thoughts.
