Distraction is the opposite of focus.

When I'm 30 minutes into a [session]({{site.url}}/sessions) and I answer the phone, check email or start an unrelated conversation, I lose my [flow]({{site.url}}/flow-breaker).  It takes another 30 minutes to get it back (*if* I get it back).

**Distraction kills productivity and distractions are everywhere.**

Example: Facebook encourages me to browse through a never-ending stream of distraction throughout my day.  When I spend hours a day on Facebook, I'm training my brain to leap around between shallow topics and accomplish nothing.  This is time I could spend [reading books]({{site.url}}/book-notes), [reflecting]({{site.url}}/look-back) or being [present]({{site.url}}/present).

I'm not saying all distractions are bad, but how many hours a day do you willfully spend in distraction mode?

Do you find it hard to focus, to get things done?
