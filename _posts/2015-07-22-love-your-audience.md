When you have our attention, be grateful.  It can disappear in an instant.

Don’t ramble too much about yourself.  Don’t brag about your accomplishments.  Don’t try to put yourself above us.

Put yourself beneath us.

Get to the point.

Get inside our heads.

Focus on us.

Feel us.

Love us.

**We are your audience and we can feel your sincerity (or lack thereof).  Don’t waste our time.**

Speak and perform what you love.  No more.  No less.  Our attention must be earned and kept.

When you have our attention, it’s tempting to think that this is about you.

It’s not about you.  It’s much simpler than that.

**Just love us.  Love your audience.**
