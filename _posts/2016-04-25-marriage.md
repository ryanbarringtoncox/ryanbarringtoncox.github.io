Some reminders-to-self on marriage:

  - Turn towards one another, not away.
  - Seek agreement when discussing tough topics.
  - Be a follower.  Let yourself be led by your partner.
  - Don't blame. Use "I" when expressing yourself instead of "you."
  - Remember good times together and make more good times together.
  - Listen. Be interested.  Know your partner's passions, hopes, dreams and fears.
  - Beware contempt, criticism, stonewalling and defensiveness.  They erode communication.
  - Beware negative history.  Couples who see their history as negative are less likely to stay together.
  - Understand that you don't have to solve every problem.  Solve the ones you can.  Be forgiving and loving with the rest.

Be intentional about marriage and keep these things in mind.

Marriage is well worth the effort.
