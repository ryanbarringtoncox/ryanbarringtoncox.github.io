If you're working hard to master something, you're probably getting better at it.  That's nice.  Be aware that your inner critic is also getting more refined.

**It can feel like you're getting worse even when you're getting better.**

As you get more immersed in something, you notice more details. As you notice more details, you see more flaws. 

This evolving inner critic can help you hone your craft.

This critic can also get you down and destroy your confidence. He might even encourage you to quit from time to time.

It helps to keep records of your earlier works.  Keep your first sketch pad, your early recordings or that video of your first performance.  Look over the source code from your first few programming projects.  Re-read those first few blogs.

**Revisit your progress periodically.**

When you go back and see your entry-level works, you'll see that you have improved.

Your critic evolves alongside your mastery.

Let him help you.

Don't let him get you down.
