I've started getting out of the office and away from screens during lunch.

Running with the sun all over my pale winter skin?

Yum.

I feel like a new man when I come back inside.

Photosynthesis happens.

To us.

(We share DNA with plants, right?)

I'm no biologist, but I I feel rejuvenated and reborn after I've gotten some sun.

That blistering, burning source of gravity and energy.

No wonder people used to worship the sun.
