Read this [interview](http://splitsider.com/2014/07/mike-birbiglia-and-the-importance-and-power-of-jokes/) with Mike Birbiglia, who blends stand-up comedy and storytelling masterfully.  Here are some excerpts that struck a chord

*You need to make your stories about the audience, and not really about yourself, even though you’re saying a lot of details about yourself, you’re really trying to tap into what it is that you and the audience have in common.*

*I always defer on the side of thinking the other character is better or nicer or smarter than me in the story. Especially my wife.*

*There are certain conveniences in storytelling that tend to not bore and confuse the audience, because when you’re telling a long-form narrative, really what you’re gonna do is convey like a big, long story as though it were a really simple story. Like, I think one of the really good exercises that one of my college writing professors taught me about screenwriting is that — and I think this goes for storytelling too — you should be able to tell it really quickly. Supposedly Steven Spielberg doesn’t like movie pitches that are more than 25 words... You want to be able to just convey it quickly. Because ultimately, those details and those kind of long strung out unrefined narratives, those are for your therapist. Audiences come to see refined, thought-through, well-articulated stories.*
