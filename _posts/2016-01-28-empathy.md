If you read these posts, you know I love setting and achieving [goals]({{site.url}}/now).

I'm astounded by what I can accomplish when I get clear on what I want and keep my [intent]({{site.url}}/intent) fixed on it.

This blog helps me with goal-setting, confidence and ambition.  However, these very qualities create [blind spots]({{site.url}}/blind-spots) in my life when I'm not empathetic towards others.

It's not enough to know what I want.

It's not enough to *get* what I want either.

To live a good life, I must be [aware]({{site.url}}/awareness-is-a-vessel) of others' feelings.  This is an area where I need to improve.

**Getting intimate with one's own feelings, thoughts and dreams is a lifelong and worthy ambition.**

**Balance that ambition with empathy.**
