title: It's Not Mandatory.

Sometimes I find myself thinking things like, "Everyone should do public speaking in Elementary School" or "We should all be required to learn to program computers."

Then I remember those are things I choose to do. That's why I'm learning.

**Because I choose.**

**Because I care.**

In fact, I was exposed to public speaking at a young age and didn't go for it.  I'm still not sure if that was the timing or the circumstances.

I am sure that I had to come to these pursuits on my own to benefit from them.

**Making something mandatory doesn't necessarily make it learned.**

We have to want to learn something in order to learn it. Even then, it generally takes lots of work, focus and time.

No need to make more things mandatory. It's better to cultivate interest.

I'm not trying to figure out what should be mandatory anymore. Now I'm asking

  - How do we cultivate interest for a subject?
  - How do we arouse passion in ourselves, in those that we are teaching?

When we care enough to choose a pursuit, learning truly begins.
