Threat.

It's a pretty intense word, eh?  My heart-rate goes up a few beats just writing it.

When was the last time you felt threatened?  What made you feel threatened?

Was it a pack of wild wolves chasing you from your mailbox to your house?

Or was it a person at work?  An idea? A conversation?

The pack of wild wolves is a valid threat.  Fight or flight.  Drop the mail and haul ass to the door.

The latter examples, people and conversations, don't warrant the same reaction, but they are more likely to threaten me in my daily life.

**I'm noticing that my reactions to threat are often unoptimized.  When I'm threatened, I'm more likely to be edgy, rushed, in a panic.**

I tend to handle threats better when I'm clear-headed, calm, breathing and taking my time. Still, the survival instinct is hardwired into me.

It all starts by noticing when I'm feeling threatened.

Acknowledge threat.  Take a breath.  Take my time.

It's going to be alright regardless, but probably a lot better when I'm calm and composed.  Unless it's the pack of wild wolves of course. In that case, screw the mail and haul ass to the door.
