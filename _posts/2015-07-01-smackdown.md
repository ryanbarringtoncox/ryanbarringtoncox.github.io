You're in your element.

Your risks are paying off. Your jokes are landing.

You've got swagger.

All of the sudden... BLAMMO!. You get the smackdown.

Embarrassed. Ignored. Fooled in front of the crowd.

Spanked?!

That's justice.

**The smackdown is the universe keeping you in check.**

"Don't get a big head," she says.

Yes, let's grow our skills.

Yes, let's build our confidence. 

**Yes, let's keep our humility.** 

As our power grows, so does the need for humility.

Thanks to the smackdown for keeping us in check.
