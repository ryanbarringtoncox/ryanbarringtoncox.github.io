*Love is a rose but you better not pick it.*\\
*It only grows when it's on the vine.*\\
*A handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it.*\\
*You lose your love when you say the word 'mine.'*\\
  - Neil Young

This concludes ten intentional posts on [Love](/love).  I'd like to be an older person with a bigger heart.

Here are some thoughts on love.

  - Love is empathy.  It's walking a mile in another person's heart.
  - Love is vulnerability.  It's keeping the walls down, letting myself feel more pleasure and pain.
  - Love is an opposite of anger.  Anger is getting tight, defensive and reacting with rage.  Love is softening, opening up and accepting.
  - Love hurts sometimes.  Physically.  It takes courage to care so deeply.  It's no wonder so many people get ground down and hardened by life, letting less love in over time.
  - Love is surrender.
  - Love gets us high.  We want more.  We want too much.  We try to capture love and it vanishes.
  - Love is fleeting and everlasting.

Love is the lush countryside outside the train window.

Storms rage.

Birds sing.

We are along for the ride.

If we want to be.
