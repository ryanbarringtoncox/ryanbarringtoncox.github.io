Some key takeaways from Zara Brach's wonderful book, *Radical Acceptance: Embracing Your Life with the Heart of a Buddha.*

  - Love yourself.  This is not as easy or simple as it sounds.  You have to forgive yourself for what you've been and what you are in order to love life and others fully.
  - Pause and accept.  Don't make things worse by reacting too quickly, saying too much or adding more tension to difficult situations. Let things be. 
  - We are all connected.  Helping others is helping yourself.  Seriously.
  - Come home to the body.  Make time *every day* to sit in stillness.   Watch your breath, thoughts and feelings without judgement.
  - Desire is part of the human condition.  It's normal to compare yourself to others, to want more than you have.  Be aware of desire and its tendency to bring suffering.
  - Be grateful for what you have.
