title: Know Your Audience
---
I burned myself last week because I didn't consider my audience quite enough.  I assumed I would be speaking to a group of people who know me intimately.  I wrote something risky based on these assumptions.  Then I found myself speaking to a group of strangers, people who know nothing about me.  My exaggerations were misunderstood and my risky humor did not land well.

It would have gone smoother if I'd asked myself questions like these.

  - Who am I speaking to?
  - What do they want?
  - Are they with me right now?  How about now?

I'll never know all the answers to questions like these, but there is merit in asking.

**I missed the opportunity to change course based on an audience response.**

I want to be more [aware]({{site.url}}/awareness-is-a-vessel) of others' feelings, *especially* when the spotlight is on me.

Note to self: Know your audience.
