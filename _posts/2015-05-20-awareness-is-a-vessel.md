"Awareness is more like a vessel which can hold and contain our thinking, helping us to see and know our thoughts as thoughts rather than getting caught up in them as reality." - Jon Kabat-Zinn

----
I read Jon's excellent book, *Wherever You Go, There You Are*, fifteen years ago.  It was a splendid gift from my older sister.  I've re-read it several times since.  This book was my first exposure to meditation.  Various quotes come back to me on a regular basis.

This idea of awareness as a vessel is ringing truer than ever lately.

If you read these posts, you know that I think a lot.  Too much, perhaps.  I love getting excited about ideas and process. It's in my nature.

I also know that my thoughts are not reality.  I meditate daily to cultivate awareness, to keep a sense of the larger context.  Awareness holds everything that I perceive, including my thoughts.

**The more thinking I do, the more I need to step back and become aware.**

To become aware of my breath, body and emotions.

To become aware of the limits of my thinking.

To remember that my thoughts are only thoughts.

Thinking is a powerful tool, but awareness encompasses more.

**If I had to choose between intelligence and awareness, I'd choose awareness.**

Today I strive to be aware first and clever second.
