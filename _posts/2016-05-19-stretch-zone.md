title: Stretch Zone

An excellent teacher told me that playing my favorite songs, the ones I already know, isn't practice. It may be fun, but true practice is getting into my stretch zone, the place where I'm pushing my limits.

**Stretch zones are uncomfortable.**

When I'm in my stretch zone, struggling to learn a new skill, it's tempting to quit or distract myself with a quick peek at Facebook.  Don't do it! Keep [focused]({{site.url}}/focus).

Learning to push through discomfort and stay in the stretch zone regularly is *the* way to acquire remarkable new skills. Most people are unwilling to do this with any regularity.

[Deep Work]({{site.url}}/deep-work) is best spent in stretch zones.  This is where I get the maximum return on my time.

Great athletes train their bodies in the stretch zone.  It works for the mind as well.

Try it.  Set aside some time to focus in your stretch zone. And don't check Facebook.
