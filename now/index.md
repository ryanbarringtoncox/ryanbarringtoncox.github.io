Right now, I'm working on -

  - Being [present]({{ site.url }}/present), especially as a husband and father. I want to [enjoy]({{site.url}}/enthusiasm) my time, listen, laugh, [love]({{ site.url }}/ten-posts-on-love) and [communicate]({{site.url}}/have-a-point)
  - Living [healthily]({{ site.url }}/sleep-nutrition-exercise)
  - Becoming a kickass [software tester]({{ site.url }}/testing) (without losing my [developer chops]({{site.url}}/how-to-think))
  - [Leading]({{site.url}}/love-your-audience/) my [speaking club]({{site.url}}/public-speaking-and-living-with-fear) as president, writing/performing a new [story or speech]({{ site.url }}/stories) each month
  - Dabbling in [stand-up]({{site.url}}/comedy), getting laughs
  - Becoming debt-free
  - [Blogging]({{ site.url }}/posts) my way from [confusion]({{site.url}}/confusion-confidence) to [lesson]({{site.url}}/hang-loose)
  - [Reading books]({{site.url}}/book-notes), [learning]({{site.url}}/meta-learning) new things, expanding my [mind]({{site.url}}/metacognition)
  - Recording quick [DIY videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEP0Foq1SruN9ZA-dz9VbSYaLCF1gWnVP) of my songs and covers.  Not a high priority, but fun.

My [/bucket page]({{site.url}}/bucket) holds the things I'll do someday, when I have time.
