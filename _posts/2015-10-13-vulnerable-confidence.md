Confidence may seem hard.

Vulnerability can appear weak.

I want the confidence to be vulnerable.  I want to stand my ground *and* give the benefit of the doubt.

Let's be honest: There are primal urges beneath the social surface.  We are wilder than we admit.

The potential for conflict is ever-present.  Conflict can be a small misunderstanding with a colleague or a full blown physical attack.

Arrogance overcompensates for this potential.  Bullies are too loud.  They push too hard.

Weakness undercompensates. Cowards avoid conflict at the expense of integrity.

Arrogance and fear are both out of balance.  Each raises the potential for violence.

Arrogance starts conflict and fear draws it in.

Don't confuse arrogance with confidence or vulnerability with fear.

I need the confidence to confront problems early and often.

I need the vulnerability to empathize and trust others.

Walk the balance beam between vulnerability and confidence.
