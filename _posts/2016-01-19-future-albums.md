title: Future Albums
---
I used to record an <a target="_blank" href="https://ryanbarringtoncox.bandcamp.com/">album</a> of [my music]({{site.url}}/music) every year.  Nowadays I don't have the time to keep that up.

I miss making albums.  I make them for me (like a photo album).  I love capturing a time period and learning more about what's going on inside me.  [Singing]({{site.url}}/sing) feels good and [reflecting]({{site.url}}/look-back) back years later always reveals interesting things.

Moving forward, I want to make an album every 2-3 years.  I want each one to be unique, to stand apart from my previous efforts.  Let this post serve as a reminder (to me) of my future album ideas. Here are the future albums I want to make.  

  - A mostly live psych-rock album with songs in "exotic" modes.
  - An electro-pop album - built with beats, loops and synths - that sounds nothing like my other albums.
  - A collection of songs that are arranged with only vocals and percussion.  No guitars, bass, keys, etc.
  - An album where I sing songs in a wooden room with a drummer, keep the live vocal take with bleed and pepper in other instruments as needed. The raw vocal track will serve as most of the mix.
  - A no-nonsense iPhone-recorded collection of my favorite songs and comedy bits.  This should be quick and easy to do since everything is captured live and requires no overdubbing or mixing.

Each album should sound great to my ears, but [perfection]({{site.url}}/perfection) is not the goal.  Capturing something new, interesting and honest is.

I look forward to making more albums in the future.
