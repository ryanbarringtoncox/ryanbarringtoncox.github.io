It happens more often than I would like.

I have challenging things to accomplish and I'm watching the clock. Things are not going as quickly as I'd hoped.

Then that old familiar paradox kicks in. I'm worried that I won't finish soon enough so I feel rushed.  Rushing brings haphazard stress with it. My mind becomes scattered and cloudy.  I'm losing my focus.

Soon the feeling of being rushed has overwhelmed me. I'm paralyzed and nothing gets done.

Take it easy, Ryan! It's going to be alright.  Seriously.

**Step back.**

**Take a breath.**

**Take a break.**

**Slow down.**

**I accomplish more when I take my time.**

I need not rush, feel rushed, be rushed or let rushing get the best of me.

Itâ€™s far better to lean into confusion with a relaxed attitude and the willingness to take breaks early and often.

Go slowly.  Go relaxedly.  That's how I'll accomplish the most.
