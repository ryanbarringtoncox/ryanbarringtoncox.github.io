“Be ok with the way things are.”  Wise words from my wife.  They didn’t sink in the first few dozen times.  They are sinking in now.

Such a simple concept.  Something I struggle with so much.  When I’m running late in the morning and I grab my daughter’s milk and it spills everywhere.  When I’m awakened in the middle of the night by screaming dogs.  When I lose money foolishly.

I’ve had a bit of a temper at times.  It’s easy to be pleasant and agreeable when things are going my way.  **When things go off the rails, that’s when we find out who we really are.**

I’m trying to own up to these moments and faults more (hence this post).  I’d like to create habits and rituals that bring my awareness to my reactions.  Especially when the shit hits the fan.

I’ve wasted enough time and health holding onto negative feelings, surrendering my power to the external. **I yearn to take responsibility for my reactions, to own them and try to make art with them.**

I’m not saying I want to ignore my frustrations, bury them or pretend they’re not there.  Just the opposite.  I want to go head to head, acknowledge them, be aware as soon as they arise.  I want to sit with them, watch them and try to better understand them.

I hereby publicly commit to being a better reactor!  To the pursuit of the **Art of Reaction**.

There are sure to be failures along the way.  Next time you see me freak out, please remind me that I wrote this.
