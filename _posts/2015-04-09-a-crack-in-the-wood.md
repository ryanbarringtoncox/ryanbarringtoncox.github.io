We were building wooden panels on our porch last weekend.  There was a crack in one of the panel frames' wood.

That crack was staring me in the eye.

In that moment, the crack overshadowed the beauty surrounding it.

As programmers, we are trained to see flaws early and often, to nip bugs in the bud.  This can be a good thing.

Other times, this is nitpicky and controlling.  Sometimes we have to accept the cracks in our surroundings, in the people in our lives.

There will always be cracks in the wood.  Sometimes we can fix them.  Sometimes we can't.

We fixed this particular crack with wood glue and a clamp.  Now I can't see it any more.  Still, the lesson remains.

When we can't fix a crack, we should enjoy their place in the larger system. Imperfections can give art a flare of soul.
