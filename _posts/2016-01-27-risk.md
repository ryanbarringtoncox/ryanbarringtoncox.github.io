title: Risk
---
Take a risk.\\
\\
Do something scary.\\
\\
Venture out on a limb\\
without expectation.\\
\\
Make a joke.\\
\\
Start a blog.\\
\\
Apply for a job\\
that pays more.\\
\\
Tell someone\\
you appreciate them\\
(or better yet\\
you love them)\\
\\
There's fruit\\
at the edges\\
of comfort,\\
apples in\\
risk-taking.\\
\\
Reach out.\\
\\
Pluck one.
