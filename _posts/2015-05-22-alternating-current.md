"Do I contradict myself?  Very well then. I contradict myself. I am large. I contain multitudes." - Walt Whitman

I get all these ideas about [tracking my time](/time-tracking), [focusing](/focus) and [learning](/four-levels-of-learning).  I delve into these ideas, enjoy them and gain new perspectives. It feels right.

**Ideas give me zeal.**

Here's another idea.  Periodically, when I feel bored, tired or limited by an idea, I can discard it.  I may come back to it.  I may not

**Routines become stale.**

Ideas can set us free or confine us.  I am a free man.  I need to continually renew and redefine. It starts with ideas.

Sometimes I'll find harmony with the opposite of what I've been doing. Then I allow my mind to wander from one thing to the next.  I let myself be unfocused and undisciplined.  This feels right too.

There is no pressure to be directly productive all the time.  When I discard my itinerary, I allow my subconscious to take over and drive.  Space opens up for chance encounters.  Results can seep out of that deep, dark artistic well.  These are the ideas you can't plan for. They have a different flavor.

**Sometimes stopping and hitting reverse is just what the doctor ordered.**

Keep going backwards til the engine dies.  Get out.  Start walking.  Find a new idea.

There is alternating current.  The power of opposites.

  - Try one idea.
  - Stop.
  - Do the opposite.
  - Repeat.

I'll come back to an idea only if it becomes enticing or useful again.  There is not need to commit to ideas (I save my commitments for the people I love).

Am I contradicting myself in these posts? That's because I contain multitudes.

And so do you.
