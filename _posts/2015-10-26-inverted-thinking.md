When I want to make strong, working software, I'll think, "How can I break it?"

When I want to give a great performance, I'll wonder, "What's a sure way I can sabotage this performance?"

When I want to embody healthier habits, I'll ask myself, "What are the scenarios where I make the worst health choices?"

Trying to solve a problem or improve a process?  Invert your thinking.

Think of the opposite and go from there.
