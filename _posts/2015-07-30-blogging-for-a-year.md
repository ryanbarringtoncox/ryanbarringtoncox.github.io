I've been blogging for a year now.  That's [115 posts](/posts).

[Writing publicly](/meta-blog/) has made me more [intentional](/intent) and [healthy](/sleep-nutrition-exercise).  It's also increased my [mindfulness](/thoughts-on-meditation/) of [learning](/meta-learning), [loving](/love) and [risk-taking](/risking-embarrassment).

Here are some specific things that I've learned from (and about) blogging.

 - Don't over-think your art.  Churn it out.  [Quality produces quality](/blogging-daily).
 - [Less is more](/simplicity).
 - Always have a [point](/carving-the-block).  A point fits neatly into a simple sentence. Humans are too rambly by default.
 - Only write about things that inspire, interest and move you. [Enthusiasm](/enthusiasm) is the great secret.
 - Write for yourself. If anybody else enjoys a post, that's an unexpected bonus.
 - Everyday life is filled with [interesting nuggets](/tension).  Writing gets you in the habit of noticing and appreciating.
 - Don't play it safe.  If you're nervous about writing something, you're onto something worthwhile.

If you're wondering if you should blog or not, the answer is "Yes, you should!"

This blog has opened doors and I'm excited to see where they lead.

Thanks for reading.
