When I get excited my mind leaps around between the projects I'm working on.

I'll be thinking about songs, then software, then a speech and it's back to the songs.  And so on and so on, all in the span of a few minutes.

In the past, I've worried that this is counterproductive.  I've tried to stop the leaping and [focus](/focus) on one thing.

**Now I realize that mental leaps are a natural search for the underlying unity among ideas. Leaps can bridge the gaps.**

**It's all one thing underneath after all.**

Focus is a wonderful tool, but it's okay to let the mind leap and be unrestrained too.

The mind will find common ground and connect on her own if we let her.

Lighten up, let go and embrace the leaps as a journey towards unity.
