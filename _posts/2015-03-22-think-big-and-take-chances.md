Think big and take chances.  That's the best advice that I have to offer.

Most people think small and settle for too little.  There is a hierarchy of power that keeps us dreaming small, content to keep our heads low and stay "stable" and "safe."

Few are the people who not only dream big, but give off their asses and take active risks regularly .

There is less competition at the top.

The bottom is crowded, overrun by folks who don't really believe they deserve more.

There's the rub.  We have to believe that we deserve great things.  Love, friendship or a career that inspires us.

Do you believe that you're destined for great things?

I believe that thinking big and taking chances puts us in an elite minority.
