Your daddy issues are not as bad as your dad's daddy issues.

My best childhood friend shot himself with a digital camera.

I don't think I'm better than anybody, except people who ride segways.

Nothing makes my skin crawl like walking down a long hallway towards anybody else.

Rock n Roll peaked in the 70s - 1971, Stairway to Heaven, 1979, Highway to Hell - and by the 80s, Rock was Living on a Prayer.

My doctor says I can't sleep at night because I have insomnia, which is like saying, "You can't sleep at night because you can't sleep at night."
