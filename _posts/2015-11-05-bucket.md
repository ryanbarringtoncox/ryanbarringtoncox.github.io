Try to do everything and nothing gets done.

This bucket holds the things I will do later, when my schedule allows.

  - Start a podcast and interview people who inspire me
  - Perform longer sets of [comedy]({{site.url}}/on-comedy), keep the laughs rolling
  - [Tai Chi]({{site.url}}/relax): Push hands again regularly and learn the sword form
  - Make more quick and dirty [DIY videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEP0Foq1SruN9ZA-dz9VbSYaLCF1gWnVP) of my songs and covers
  - Put out more <a target="_blank" href="https://ryanbarringtoncox.bandcamp.com/">albums</a> (goal: one every 2-3 years; more details [here](/future-albums))
  - Do more acts of public service (i.e. teach programming or music to kids, volunteer, listen, etc)
  - Do further [research]({{site.url}}/book-notes) on health, history, meditation, comedy, mathematics, chaos, data visualization, survivalism, economics and investing
  - Tell a story on [The Moth](http://themoth.org/) and/or deliver a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks)
  - Publish a book
