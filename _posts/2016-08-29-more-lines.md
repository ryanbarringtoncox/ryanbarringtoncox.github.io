Babies are like transistor radios.  You have to keep moving them around to get good reception.

Dry cleaning makes about as much sense as desert drowning.

The opposite of a cold front is a pair of sideburns.

If pigs could fly, I could eat ham wings.

The voices in my head get a bad rap.

The last thing I want to do is die.
