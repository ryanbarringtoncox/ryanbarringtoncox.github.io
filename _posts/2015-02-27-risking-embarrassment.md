I spent a couple decades running from embarrassment. I'm pretty sure this started when I left the innocence of Elementary School behind.

At the age of 11, I was cast into the scary world of Middle School.  No more Duck Duck Goose at Middle School. Suddenly, there were cigarettes, rampant hormones and bullies... who shaved!

As a child, I acted naturally and didn't worry what people thought. I spoke from the gut and generally had a good time.

At Middle School, I became afraid of disapproval and laughter. I got a taste of embarrassment.  I held back and lowered my eyes.

I grew up and got over it (mostly), but there was still a lingering voice within me saying, "Play it safe.  Don't stand out. They might laugh at you."

I'm done listening to that voice.  I yearn to go full circle and get back to the uninhibited kid within.

Why worry about embarrassment?

Why fear putting myself out there?

Why run from saying the things I feel?

Risking embarrassment makes my pulse quicken.  It makes me feel alive.

**I'm starting to see the embarrassment-riskers as the true heroes, the ones that take life the farthest.**

I've started risking embarrassment and I've yet to regret it. In fact, my regrets tend to stem from avoiding risk, not confronting it.
