Right now, I'm -

  - Living [healthily]({{ site.url }}/sleep-nutrition-exercise)
  - Being [present]({{ site.url }}/present), especially as a husband and father. I want to [enjoy]({{site.url}}/enthusiasm), listen, laugh, [love]({{ site.url }}/ten-posts-on-love) and [communicate]({{site.url}}/have-a-point)
  - [Speaking publicy]({{site.url}}/public-speaking-and-living-with-fear) at least twice a week (doing [stand-up comedy]({{site.url}}/comedy) 50 times before July, 2017).
  - Exploring the art of [software testing]({{ site.url }}/testing) (without losing my [developer chops]({{site.url}}/how-to-think))
  - [Reading books]({{site.url}}/book-notes), [learning]({{site.url}}/meta-learning) new things, expanding my [mind]({{site.url}}/metacognition)
  - Becoming [debt-free]({{site.url}}/debt)
  - [Blogging]({{ site.url }}/posts)

My [/bucket page]({{site.url}}/bucket) holds the things I'll do someday.
