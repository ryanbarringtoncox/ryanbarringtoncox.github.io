title: Injury
---
I overdid it exercising this week and injured my left chest and shoulder.  It feels okay when I'm lying down, but standing or sitting hurts.

Lying around all day goes against my nature.  There are things I want to do.

But I can't. I have to take it easy.  

And it's good to take it easy.

Injury makes me stop, reflect and feel.  How ironic that I injured myself by trying to be healthier and stronger.

Now I'm resting, [listening]({{site.url}}/listen) and [empathizing]({{site.url}}/empathy) with my shell.

Injury is opportunity.
